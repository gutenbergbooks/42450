<h2 class="p6">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Virginia, or the Old Dominion, as her children delight to
call her, has always been famed for the style of her living.
Taught by the example of her royal colonial governors, and
the numerous adherents of King Charles, who brought hither
in their exile the graces and luxuriousness of his brilliant
court, she became noted among the colonies for the princely
hospitality of her people and for the beauty and richness of their
living. But when at length her great son in the House of
Burgesses sounded the cry of war, and her people made haste
to gird themselves for the long struggle, her daughters, not to
be outdone either in services or patriotism, set about at once
the inauguration of a plan of rigid retrenchment and reform in
the domestic economy, while at the same time exhibiting to
their sisters a noble example of devotion and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Tearing the glittering arms of King George from their sideboards,
and casting them, with their costly plate and jewels, as
offerings into the lap of the Continental Congress, they introduced
in their homes that new style of living in which, discarding
all the showy extravagance of the old, and retaining only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
its inexpensive graces, they succeeded in perfecting that system
which, surviving to this day, has ever been noted for its beautiful
and elegant simplicity.</p>

<p>This system, which combines the thrifty frugality of New
England with the less rigid style of Carolina, has been justly
pronounced, by the throngs of admirers who have gathered from
all quarters of the Union around the generous boards of her
illustrious sons, as the very perfection of domestic art.</p>

<p>It is the object of the compiler of this book, for she does not
claim the title of author, to bring within the reach of every
American housekeeper who may desire it, the domestic principles
and practices of these famous Virginia homes. In doing
this she has not sought to pursue the plan adopted by so many
authors of such books&mdash;to depend upon her own <i>authorship</i> for
her rule. She confesses that in this matter her labors have
been largely editorial.</p>

<p>Through a long life it has been her good fortune to be a frequent
visitor, and often the intimate guest and kinswoman, at
many of these homes; and she has sought, by the opportunities
thus afforded, and guided by her own extensive experience as a
housekeeper, to gather and select from these numerous sources
those things which seemed to her best and most useful to the
practical housewife, and which, carefully observed, would bring
the art within reach of all who have the ambition to acquire it.</p>

<p>It will be seen that she is indebted to near 250 contributors
to her book. Among these will be found <i>many names famous</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
<i>through the land</i>. Associated with them will be discovered
others of less national celebrity, but who have acquired among
their neighbors an equally merited distinction for the beautiful
order and delightful cuisine of their homes.</p>

<p>The labors of the writer have been greatly lightened by the
kindness of these contributors. And she desires in this public
way to renew her thanks for the aid which they have given her,
but even more for the goodness which prompts them, at cost of
their sensitiveness, to allow her to append their names to the
recipes which they furnish.</p>

<p>The book, after great care in its preparation, is now offered
to the public with much confidence. All that is here presented
has been so thoroughly tested, and approved by so many of the
best housekeepers in Virginia, that she feels it must meet with
a cordial and very general reception at the hands of all accomplished
housewives throughout the land, and will supply a long-felt
and real need.</p>

<p>If she shall thus succeed in disseminating a knowledge of the
practice of the <i>most admirable system of domestic art known in
our country</i>; if she shall succeed in lightening the labors of the
housewife by placing in her reach a guide which will be found
<i>always trusty and reliable</i>; if she shall thus make her tasks
lighter and home-life sweeter; if she shall succeed in contributing
something to the health of American children by instructing
their mothers in the art of preparing light and wholesome
and palatable food; <i>if she, above all, shall succeed in making
American homes more attractive to American husbands, and spare</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span>
<i>them a resort to hotels and saloons for those simple luxuries which
their wives know not how to provide</i>; if she shall thus add to the
comfort, to the health and happy contentment of these, she will
have proved in some measure a public benefactor, and will feel
amply repaid for all the labor her work has cost.</p>

<p class="center p6 b15">HOUSEKEEPING IN OLD VIRGINIA.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2 class="chap1">BREAD.</h2>

<p>Bread is so vitally important an element in our nourishment
that I have assigned to it the first place in my work. Truly, as
Frederika Bremer says, "when the bread rises in the oven, the
heart of the housewife rises with it," and she might have added
that the heart of the housewife sinks in sympathy with the
sinking bread.</p>

<p>I would say to housewives, be not daunted by one failure, nor
by twenty. Resolve that you <i>will</i> have good bread, and never
cease striving after this result till you have effected it. If persons
without brains can accomplish this, why cannot you? I
would recommend that the housekeeper acquire the practice as
well as the theory of bread-making. In this way, she will be
able to give more exact directions to her cook and to more
readily detect and rectify any blemish in the bread. Besides, if
circumstances should throw her out of a cook for a short time,
she is then prepared for the emergency. In this country
fortunes are so rapidly made and lost, the vicissitudes of life
are so sudden, that we know not what a day may bring forth.
It is not uncommon to see elegant and refined women brought
suddenly face to face with emergencies which their practical
knowledge of household economy and their brave hearts enable
them to firmly meet and overcome.</p>

<p>To return to the bread question, however. Good flour is an
indispensable requisite to good bread. Flour, whether old or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
new, should always be sunned and aired before being used. In
the morning, get out the flour to be made up at night for next
morning's breakfast. Sift it in a tray and put it out in the sun,
or, if the day is damp, set it near the kitchen fire. Only experience
will enable you to be a good judge of flour. One test is to
rub the dry flour between your fingers, and if the grains feel
round, it is a sign that the flour is good. If after trying a
barrel of flour twice, you find it becomes wet and sticky, after
being made up of the proper consistency, you had better then
return it to your grocer.</p>

<p>The best flour is worthless without good yeast. Yeast made
up in the morning ought to be fit for use at night. It should
be foamy and frothy, with a scent slightly like ammonia. After
closely following the directions for yeast-making, given in the
subsequent pages, the bread will be apt to succeed, if the flour
employed is good.</p>

<p>There is a great art in mixing bread, and it is necessary to
observe a certain rotation in the process. To make a small
quantity of bread, first sift one quart of flour; into that sift a
teaspoonful of salt, next rub in an Irish potato, boiled and
mashed fine, then add a piece of lard the size of a walnut, and
next a half teacup of yeast in which three teaspoonfuls of
white sugar have been stirred. (Under no circumstances use
soda or saleratus in your light dough.) Then make into a soft
dough with cold water in summer, and lukewarm in winter.
Knead without intermission for half an hour, <i>by the clock</i>.
Otherwise five minutes appear to be a half hour when bread is
being kneaded or beaten. Then place it in a stone crock, greased
with lard at the bottom, and set it to rise. In summer, apply no
artificial heat to it, but set it in a cool place. As bread rises
much more quickly in summer than in winter, you must make
allowance for this difference, during the respective seasons.
The whole process, including both the first and second rising, may
be accomplished in seven or eight hours in summer, though this
will be regulated partly by the flour, as some kinds of flour rise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
much more quickly than others. In summer you may make it
up at nine o'clock <span class="s08">P.M.</span>, for an eight o'clock breakfast next
morning, but in winter, make it up at seven <span class="s08">P.M.</span>, and then set it
on a shelf under which a lighted coal-oil lamp is placed. If you
can have a three-cornered shelf of slate or sheet-iron, placed in a
corner of the kitchen, just above the bread block, it will be all
the better, though a common wooden shelf, made very thin, will
answer, where you cannot get the other. The coal-oil lamp
underneath without running the risk of burning the shelf (if
wooden), will keep the bread gently heated all night, and will
answer the double purpose of keeping a light burning, which
most persons like to do at night, and which they can do with
scarcely any expense, by using a coal-oil lamp.</p>

<p>Never knead bread a second time in the morning, as this
ruins it. Handle lightly as possible, make into the desired
shapes and put into the moulds in which it is to be baked.
Grease your hands before doing this, so as to grease the loaf or
each roll as you put it in, or else dip a feather in lard and pass
lightly over the bread just before putting it in the oven to
bake. Let it be a little warmer during the second rise than
during the first. Always shape and put in the moulds two
hours before breakfast. If hot bread is desired for dinner, reserve
part of the breakfast dough, keeping it in the kitchen in
winter, and in the refrigerator in summer till two hours before
dinner.</p>

<p>In baking, set the bread on the floor of the stove or range,
never on the shelf. Always turn up the damper before baking
any kind of bread. As you set the bread in the stove, lay a
piece of stiff writing paper over it to keep it from browning before
heating through. Leave the door ajar a few minutes, then
remove the paper and shut the door. When the top of the loaf
is a light amber color, put back the paper that the bread may
not brown too much while thoroughly baking. Turn the mould
around so that each part may be exposed to equal heat. Have
an empty baking-pan on the shelf above the bread, to prevent it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
from blistering: some persons fill the pan with water, but I think
this is a bad plan, as the vapor injures the bread. When thoroughly
done, wrap the bread a few moments in a clean, thick,
bread towel and send to the table with a napkin over it, to be
kept on till each person has taken his seat at table.</p>

<p>I would suggest to housekeepers to have made at a tinner's,
a sheet-iron shape for bread, eight inches long, four and one-half
inches wide, and five and one-half deep. This is somewhat like
a brickbat in shape, only deeper, and is very desirable for bread
that is to be cut in slices, and also for bread that is to be pulled
off in slices. A quart of flour will make eight large rolls, six
inches high, for this mould, and three or four turnovers. It is a
nice plan after making out the eight rolls to roll them with
greased hands till each one will reach across the pan (four and
one-half inches), making eight slices of bread which will pull off
beautifully when well done, and thus save the task of slicing
with a knife. It requires an hour to bake this bread properly.</p>

<p>Do not constantly make bread in the same shapes: each
morning, try to have some variation. Plain light bread dough
may be made into loaves, rolls, twist, turnovers, light biscuit,
etc., and these changes of shape make a pleasant and appetizing
variety in the appearance of the table. The addition of three
eggs to plain light bread dough will enable you to make French
rolls, muffins, or Sally-Lunn of it. As bread is far more appetizing,
baked in pretty shapes, I would suggest the snow-ball
shape for muffins and egg bread. Very pretty iron shapes
(eight or twelve in a group, joined together) may be procured
from almost any tinner.</p>

<p>If you should have indifferent flour of which you cannot get
rid, bear in mind that it will sometimes make excellent beaten
biscuit when it will not make good light bread. In making
beaten biscuit, always put one teaspoonful of salt, a piece of lard
the size of an egg, and a teacup of milk to a quart of flour,
adding enough cold water to make a stiff dough: no other
ingredients are admissible. Make the dough much stiffer than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
for other breads, beat steadily a half hour, <i>by the clock</i>. Cut with
a biscuit cutter or shape by hand, being careful to have the
shape of each alike and perfect. Make them not quite half an
inch thick, as they rise in baking. Do not let them touch each
other in the pan, and let the oven be very hot. It is well not
to have beaten biscuit and light bread baked at the same time,
as they require different degrees of heat. When two kinds of
bread are required, try to have two such as require the same
amount of heat. Egg bread and corn muffins require the same
degree of heat as beaten biscuit, while Sally-Lunn and muffins
need the same as light bread.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the poor man should not have as well
prepared and palatable food as the wealthy, for, by care and
pains, the finest bread may be made of the simplest materials,
and surely the loving hands of the poor man's wife and daughter
will take as much pains to make his bread nice and light as hirelings
will do for the wealthy. The mistake generally made by persons
in restricted circumstances is to make too great a use of soda
bread, which is not only less wholesome, but is more expensive
than light bread or beaten biscuit, as it requires more ingredients.
The bread, coffee and meat, which constitute the poor
man's breakfast, properly cooked, furnish a meal fit for a prince.</p>

<p>The furnishing of the kitchen is so important that I must here
say a few words on the subject. First, the housekeeper must
have a good stove or range, and it is well for her to have the
dealer at hand when it is put up, to see that it draws well.
Besides the utensils furnished with the range or stove, she must
provide every kitchen utensil needed in cooking. She must
have a kitchen safe,&mdash;a bread block in the corner, furnished
with a heavy iron beater; trays, sifters (with iron rims) steamers,
colanders, a porcelain preserving kettle, perforated skimmers
and spoons, ladles, long-handled iron forks and spoons,
sharp knives and skewers, graters, egg beaters (the Dover is
the best), plenty of extra bread pans, dippers and tins of every
kind, iron moulds for egg bread and muffins, wash pans, tea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
towels, bread towels, and hand towels, plates, knives, forks and
spoons for use of the servants, a pepper box, salt box and
dredge box (filled), a match safe, and last, but not least, a clock.
Try as far as possible to have the utensils of metal, rather than
of wood. In cases where you cannot have cold and hot water
conveyed into the kitchen, always keep on the stove a kettle of
hot water, with a clean rag in it, in which all greasy dishes and
kitchen utensils may be washed before being rinsed in the kitchen
wash pan. Always keep your cook well supplied with soap,
washing mops and coarse linen dish rags. I have noticed that if
you hem the latter, servants are not so apt to throw them away.
Insist on having each utensil cleaned immediately after being
used. Have shelves and proper places to put each article,
hooks to hang the spoons on, etc. If you cannot have an oilcloth
on your kitchen floor, have it oiled and then it may be
easily and quickly wiped over every morning. Once a week,
have the kitchen and every article in it thoroughly cleaned.
First clean the pipe of the stove, as the dust, soot and ashes fly
over the kitchen and soil everything. Then take the stove to
pieces, as far as practicable, cleaning each part, especially the
bottom, as neglect of this will prevent the bread from baking
well at the bottom. After the stove is thoroughly swept out,&mdash;oven
and all, apply stove polish. I consider "Crumbs of Comfort"
the best preparation for this purpose. It comes in small
pieces, each one of which is sufficient to clean the stove once,
and is thus less apt to be wasted or thrown away by servants than
stove polish that comes in a mass. Next remove everything
from the kitchen safe and shelves, which must be scoured before
replacing the utensils belonging to them, and these too must
first be scoured, scalded, and wiped dry. Then wash the windows,
and lastly the floor, scouring the latter unless it is oiled,
in which case, have it merely wiped over.</p>

<p>Never let a servant take up ashes in a wooden vessel. Keep
a sheet-iron pan or scuttle for the purpose. At night, always
have the water buckets filled with water and also the kettles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
setting the latter on the stove or range, in case of sickness or any
emergency during the night. Have kindling wood at hand also,
so that a fire may be quickly made, if needed.</p>

<p>Sometimes a discoloration is observable in iron kettles or
other iron vessels. This may be avoided by filling them with
hay before using them. Pour water over the hay, set the vessel
on the fire and let it remain till the water boils. After this,
scour in sand and ashes&mdash;then wash in hot soap-suds, after
which process, there will be no danger of discoloration.</p>

When done, take out the potatoes, one by one, on a fork, peel
and mash them fine, in a tray, with a large iron spoon, leaving
the boiling water on the stove during the process. Throw in
this water a handful of hops, which must scald, not boil, as it

add a teacupful of yeast and pour into glass fruit jars, or
large, clear glass bottles, to ferment, being careful not to close
them tightly. Set in a warm place in winter, a cool one in summer.
In six hours it will be ready for use, and at the end of

<h2>COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE.</h2>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To toast Coffee.</span></p>

<p>Wash and pick the coffee, put it in a very large stove-pan in
a hot oven. Stir often, giving constant attention. It must be
toasted the darkest brown, yet not one grain must be burned.
It should never be glazed, as this destroys the aroma.</p>

<p>Two pints of coffee become three pints after toasting.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Boiled Coffee.</span></p>

<p>To one quart of boiling water (poured in after scalding the
pot) stir in three gills of coffee, not ground too fine. Boil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
twenty minutes, scraping from the sides and stirring occasionally.
Five minutes before breakfast, scrape from the spout,
pour out half a teacupful, and return to the pot. Do this a
second time. Set it with the side of the pot to the fire, so that
it will be just at the boiling point. Do not let it boil, however.
Serve in the same coffee-pot.</p>

<p>Coffee should never be glazed.</p>

<p>Have a liberal supply of thick, sweet cream, also of boiled
milk, to serve with the coffee.</p>

<p>If the members of the family drop in at intervals, it is well
to keep the coffee over a round iron weight, heated just enough
to keep the coffee hot, without boiling it. This answers better
than a spirit lamp for keeping coffee hot.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span></p>

<p>Take equal quantities of Mocha, Java, Laguayra and Rio
coffee. Have the coffee roasted a chestnut brown. To every
twelve cups of coffee to be drawn, use eighteen heaping tablespoons
of the ground coffee. Have the water boiling hot, scald
the biggin or percolator, put the ground coffee in the upper
part, then pour on some boiling water for it to draw&mdash;about
two teacups if you are to make twelve cups of coffee. Let it
stand a few moments and pour again into the upper part of the
percolator the first drawn coffee. Then add, one by one, the
cups of boiling water required. It will take ten minutes for
the coffee to be ready for the table.</p>

<p>Use the best white sugar, and in winter let the milk stand

<h2>MILK AND BUTTER.</h2>

<p>The most exquisite nicety and care must be observed in the
management of milk and butter. A housekeeper should have
two sets of milk vessels (tin or earthenware, never stoneware,
as this is an absorbent). She should never use twice in succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the same milk vessels without having them scalded and
aired.</p>

<p>In warm weather, sweet milk should be set on ice, if practicable,
or if not, in a spring-house. Never put ice in sweet milk,
as this dilutes it. One pan of milk should always be set aside
to raise cream for coffee. A bucket with a close-fitting lid should
be filled with milk and set aside for dinner, one for supper, one
for breakfast, and a fourth for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>For making butter, strain unskimmed milk into a scalded
churn, where the churning is done daily. This will give sweeter
butter and nicer buttermilk than when cream is skimmed and
kept for churning, as this sometimes gives a cheesy taste to the
butter. Do not let the milk in the churn exceed blood heat.
If overheated, the butter will be white and frothy, and the milk
thin and sour. Churn as soon as the milk is turned. In summer
try to churn early in the morning, as fewer flies are swarming
then, and the butter can be made much firmer.</p>

<p>A stone churn is in some respects more convenient than a
wooden churn; but no matter which you use, the most fastidious
neatness must be observed. Have the churn scalded and
set out to sun as soon as possible after churning. Use your last
made butter for buttering bread, reserving the staler for cookery.</p>

<p>Butter should be printed early in the morning, while it is
cool. A plateful for each of the three meals should be placed
in the refrigerator ready for use. Do not set butter in a refrigerator
with anything else in it but milk, or in a safe with
anything but milk. It readily imbibes the flavor of everything
near it. After churning, butter should be taken up in what is
called "a piggin," first scalded and then filled with cold water.
With an old-fashioned butter-stick (scalded) wash and press the
butter till no water is left. Then add a little salt, finely beaten.
Beat again in a few hours, and make up in half-pound prints.
I would advise all housekeepers (even those who do not make
their own butter) to keep a piggin, a butter-stick, and a pretty
butter-print.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>To secure nice Butter for the Table in Winter.</i></p>

<p>In October and November, engage butter to be brought
weekly, fresh from the churn in rolls. Wrap each roll in a
piece of old table cloth, and put in a sweet firkin or stone jar
which has been washed with soda water, scalded and sunned
for a month before using. Pour over it a clear strong brine,
which also must have been prepared at least a week beforehand,
by pouring off the settlings and repeated strainings.
Have a nice flat rock washed and weight the butter down with
it, being careful to keep it always under the brine.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Recipe for Putting up Butter.</i></p>

<div class="block-container">
<div class="ings">
<p>2 quarts best common salt.</p>
<p>1 ounce pulverized saltpetre.</p>
<p>1 ounce white sugar.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Work the butter over three times, the last time adding an
ounce of the above mixture to every pound butter. Of course,
the butter is salted, when first made. Make the butter into
rolls and wrap in cloths or pack in jars, within four inches of
the top of each jar. If the latter is done, fill the jars with
brine and tie up closely. If the former is preferred, drop the
rolls into brine, prepared as follows:</p>

<p>To every gallon brine that will bear an egg, add one pound
white sugar and one-half ounce saltpetre. Boil well and skim.
Keep the brine closely covered. I have used butter on my
table in May, put up in this way, and it tasted as well as when
put up in October.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Clabber.</span></p>

<p>To have clabber in perfection, place in small glass dishes or
bowls enough milk to make clabber for each person. After it
has turned, set it in the refrigerator, if in summer, till called
for. By the way, refrigerators (as well as water-coolers) should
be washed every morning with water in which a tablespoonful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
of common soda has been dissolved. They should then be aired
before filling with ice for the day.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Cottage Cheese.</span></p>

<p>When the tea-kettle boils, pour the water into a pan of "loppered"
milk. It will curd at once. Stir it and turn it into a
colander, pour a little cold water over it, salt it and break it
up. A better way is to put equal parts of buttermilk and
thick milk in a kettle, over the fire, heat it almost boiling hot,
pour into a linen bag and let it drain till next day. Then take
it out, salt it, put in a little cream or butter, as it may be thick
or not, and make it up into balls the size of an orange.</p>

<h2>SOUP.</h2>

<p>As making soup is a tedious process, it is best to make
enough at once to last several days. Beef shank is most generally
used in making nutritious soup. It is best to get this
the day before using it, and soak it all night in cold, clear water.
If you cannot do this, however, get it as early in the morning
as you can. Break the bones, wash it, soak it a few minutes in
weak salt and water, and put it in a large boiler of cold water.
As soon as it begins to simmer, remove the dark scum that
rises on top. Keep the boiler closely covered, and boil very
slowly till an hour or two before dinner. Then, with a ladle,
remove all the fat from the top, as it is this element that makes
soup unwholesome. Strain and season, or, if you prefer, season
just enough for one meal, reserving the rest as foundation for
another sort of soup. It is well always to keep some of this
stock on hand in cold weather, as by the addition of a can of
tomatoes, or other ingredients, a delicious soup may be quickly
made of it. Never throw away water in which any sort of meat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
has been boiled, as it is much better to simmer hash or a stew
in this liquor than in water, and it is also invaluable for basting
fowls or meats that have not been parboiled.</p>

<p>Directions for soup making are so fully given in the following
pages that it is needless for me to say anything further on
the subject here.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup.</span></p>

<p>Empty the oysters into a colander and drain off all the liquor;
then strain the liquor through a very coarse cloth to rid it of
all scum, etc. To a whole can of oysters take a quart of milk.</p>

<p>Put the milk, oyster liquor, one level tablespoonful flour
rubbed very smooth with one heaping tablespoonful of butter,
one tablespoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful pepper, all on the
fire together in a farina-boiler (or put a skillet one-third filled
with boiling water under the saucepan, to prevent the milk
burning). When it comes to a boil, put in the oysters and let
them stew for twenty minutes or till the gill of the oyster turns
and begins to ruffle and crimp at the edge. Serve immediately,
for if they are cooked too long, they become hard, dark and
tasteless. If you put the salt in last, it will not curdle the
soup. Some add one level teaspoonful whole cloves and same
of mace, tied up in a net bag, but they are little improvement.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Purée of Oysters.</span></p>

butter and brown flour.</p>

<p>Let it now boil nearly an hour longer, and just before serving
it, stir in one tablespoonful sugar browned in a frying-pan,

<p class="recipe"><i>Ox-tail Soup.</i></p>

<p>Wash and soak three tails; pour on them one gallon cold
water; let them be brought gradually to boil, throw in one and
a half ounce salt, and clear off the scum carefully as soon as it
forms on the surface. When it ceases to rise, add:</p>

hours. If the tails be very large, lift them out, strain the
liquor and strain off all the fat. Cut the meat from the tails
and put it in two quarts or more of the stock. Stir in, when
this begins to boil, a thickening of arrow-root or of rice flour,
mixed with as much cayenne and salt as may be required to
flavor the soup, and serve very hot.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P.</i></p>

hours, then put in the chickens and boil until done: add one-half
pint milk and a little thickening; pepper and salt to the
taste. After taking off the soup, put in a piece of butter size
of an egg. Squirrel soup is good made the same way, but takes

<p>Sassafras Gumbo is made in the same way, except after the
fowl has boiled until the flesh has left the bone, just before taking
off the fire, stir in one tablespoonful sassafras flour. Oysters
are a great improvement to sassafras gumbo. Gather the sassafras
leaves green, and dry in the shade, as sage; when thoroughly
dry, rub through a sieve and bottle and cork tightly. It is
nice in beef soup instead of okra.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Stewed Oysters.</i></p>

<p>Take one-quarter pound nice butter, put it in a pan and melt,
then pepper and salt, add a small piece of cheese. When it is
all melted add one pint of oyster liquor, and boil; when hot,
strain and put back in pan, then add oysters and boil five minutes.&mdash;<i>Mr. K. N.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Stewed Oysters.</i></p>

<p>2 tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful black pepper.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let them simmer until the oysters are plump; take them out
with a fork and drop them into a tureen, on a handful of crackers
and three heaping tablespoonfuls fresh butter.</p>

<p>Pour one pint milk to the liquor, let it boil up and strain it
on the oysters. Rinse out the stew-pan and pour the oysters,
liquor, etc., back into it, and set it on the fire. When it comes
to a boil, serve.</p>

<p>This method deprives the oysters of the bits of shell.&mdash;<i>Mrs

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>To Stew Oysters.</i></p>

<p>Put into the kettle one pint liquor, one-half pound butter,

<p>Let it boil, then put in the oysters, after draining them in a
colander. They will be done as soon as they boil up, or when
they curl right well. When ready to take up, add half teacup
cracker crumbs and a little salt in the stew.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>To Stew Oysters.</i></p>

<p>Put into a shallow stew-pan the oysters. As soon as the gills
begin to open pour off all the liquor. Continue to cook them,
stirring all the time until done. The liquor that was poured
off must be thickened with a good lump of butter rubbed up
with flour, and seasoned with pepper and salt, and poured boiling-hot
onto the oysters.</p>

<p>The advantage of this way of cooking is that the oysters
become large and plump.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Dr. E. R.</i></p>

<p>Oysters part with a great deal of moisture in cooking, and if
the mixture is too wet it is not as good; it should be rather dry
when done. Cover the bottom of a well-buttered dish with a
layer of very dry bread crumbs, dust over a little salt and pepper,
and stick little bits of butter all over the crumbs; then,
with a spoon, moisten it with cream. Next, place a layer of
oysters, alternating with bread crumbs, until the dish is filled,
finishing with butter and cream; invert a plate over it to keep
in the flavor. Bake three-quarters of an hour, or until the
juice bubbles to the top. Remove the plate, and brown on the
upper shelf of the oven for two or three minutes only.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Scalloped Oysters.</i></p>

<p>Those who are fond of oysters prepared in this way will find
them much more delicate when cooked entirely by reflected
heat. Have your tinner make you an old-fashioned "tin-kitchen"

are in general use at hotels, fill them with alternate layers of
oysters and rolled crackers, and lay lumps of fresh butter liberally
on top of each dish. Arrange them in the "kitchen," set
the open dish in front of a bright fire or very warm grate, and
in fifteen or twenty minutes you will find the oysters delicious.&mdash;<i>Mrs. D. P.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Scalloped Oysters.</i></p>

<p>Put on the oysters with just enough liquor to keep from
burning, and parboil slightly. Season the rest of the liquor as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
with a piece of butter and a grated cracker or stale bread

do this alternately till the dish is full. Be sure and put the
cracker crumbs at the top of the dish, and bits of butter, also
pepper: this makes it brown nicely. Set it in a hot oven; as

<h2>FISH.</h2>

<p>In selecting fish, notice if the flesh is firm and hard, the eyes
full and prominent, the scales bright, the fins stiff, and the gills
red, as all these indications denote their being fresh. Wash
the fish, rub it with salt and pepper, and lay it on a dish, or
hang it up till ready to cook. Never keep it lying in water,
either in preparing it for cooking, or in trying to keep it till the
next day.</p>

<p>In boiling fish, put it in boiling water, and simmer very
slowly. It will require an hour to boil a large fish, and about
twenty minutes for a small one. Every housekeeper should
have a fish-kettle for fish.</p>

<p>Be careful to have boiling-hot lard in the frying-pan when
you go to fry fish. First rub salt and pepper and flour or meal
on the fish, then keep it well covered while frying, as you
should do to every thing that is being fried. Doing this will
enable you to fry the fish (or other article of food) a pretty
amber color, while at the same time it will be perfectly done.</p>

<p>Always have a tin sheet for lifting boiled fish and for turning
broiled fish. Before broiling, rub with pepper and salt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and then grease with fresh butter. Lay the fish on a gridiron
well greased with sweet lard and lay the tin sheet over it.
When you wish to turn, take the gridiron from the fire, holding
the tin sheet on top the fish. Hold them together, then lay
them on a table with the tin sheet down and the gridiron uppermost.
Carefully raise the gridiron, leaving the fish lying unbroken
on the tin sheet. The cook may now easily slide the
fish on the gridiron, put it again on the fire and brown the
other side, putting the tin sheet back on top of it. Every
thing should be covered while being broiled. When done, lay
it on a dish and pour over it melted butter in which has been
stirred pepper, salt, and minced parsley. If devilled fish is
desired, add to this dressing, one tablespoonful pepper vinegar,
one of celery vinegar, one of walnut catsup, one of made mustard,
one wine-glassful of acid fruit jelly. In making sauces
for fish, never use the water in which the fish has been boiled.</p>

pages.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Fish à la Crême.</span></p>

<h2>MEATS.</h2>

<p>All meats are better in winter for being kept several weeks,
and it is well, in summer, to keep them as long as you can without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
danger of their being tainted. If it is not in your power to
keep meat in an ice-house, in summer, keep it in a cool dark cellar,
wrapped around with wet cloths, on top of which lay boughs of
elderberry. The evaporation from the cloth will keep the meat
cool and the elderberry will keep off insects.</p>

<p>If you should unfortunately be obliged to use stale meat or
poultry, rub it in and out with soda, before washing it. Tough
meats and poultry are rendered more tender by putting a little
vinegar or a few slices of lemon in the water in which they are
boiled. The use of an acid will save time and fuel in cooking
them and will render them more tender and digestible.</p>

<p>If possible, keep the meat so clean that it will not be necessary
to wash it, as water extracts the juices. When it is frozen,
lay it in cold water to thaw, and then cook quickly, to prevent
its losing its moisture and sweetness.</p>

<p>In roasting or boiling, use but little salt at first, as it hardens
meat to do otherwise. In roasting, baste frequently, to prevent
the meat from hardening on the outside, and try to preserve the
juices. If possible, roast the meat on a spit before a large, open
fire, after using salt, pepper, butter or lard, and dredging with
flour. Where an open fire-place cannot be obtained, however,
the meat may be well roasted in a stove or range. Mutton,
pork, shote and veal should be well done, but beef should be
cooked rare.</p>

<p>In boiling, put on salt meat in cold water, but fresh meat in
hot. Remember also that salt meat requires more water and a
longer time to cook than fresh. Boil slowly, removing the scum
that rises when it begins to simmer. Keep a tea-kettle of boiling
water at hand to replenish the water in the pot, as it boils
away. Do not let the meat boil too hard or too long, as this
will toughen it and extract the juices. Add salt to fresh meat,
just before it is done.</p>

<p>Lardering beef, veal, and poultry is a great improvement,
keeping it moist whilst cooking and adding richness to the flavor.
Lardering consists in introducing slips of clear fat bacon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
or salt pork, into the surface of meat, by means of a pin, sharp
at one end and cleft into four divisions at the other. This pin
may be obtained at any hardware store.</p>

<p>As the housekeeper is sometimes hurried in preparing a dish,
it will save time and trouble for her to keep on hand a bottle
of meat-flavoring compounded of the following ingredients.</p>

<div class="block-container">
<div class="ings">
<p>2 chopped onions.</p>
<p>3 pods of red pepper (chopped).</p>
<p>2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar.</p>
<p>1 tablespoonful celery seed.</p>
<p>1 tablespoonful ground mustard.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful turmeric.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful black pepper.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Put all in a quart bottle and fill it up with cider vinegar. A
tablespoonful of this mixed in a stew, steak, or gravy, will impart
not only a fine flavor, but a rich color. Keeping this mixture
on hand will obviate the necessity of the housekeeper looking
through various spice boxes and packages to get together
the requisite ingredients for flavoring, and will thus save her
time and trouble.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">How to Select Meats.</span></p>

<p>Good and wholesome meat should be neither of a pale rosy or
pink color, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the diseased
condition, the last proves the animal has died a natural death.
Good meat has more of a marble look, in consequence of the
branching of the veins which surround the adipose cells. The
fat, especially of the inner organs, is always firm and suety and
never moist, while in general the fat from diseased cattle is
flabby and watery and more often resembles jelly or boiled
parchment. Wholesome meat will always show itself firm and
elastic to the touch, and exhibit no dampness, while bad meat
will appear soft and moist, in fact, often more wet, so that the
liquid substance runs out of the blood when pressed hard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Good meat has very little smell and diffuses a certain medicinal
odor. This can be distinctly proved by cutting the meat through
with a knife and smelling the blade or pouring water over it.
Lastly, bad meat has the peculiarity that it shrinks considerably
in the boiling, wholesome meat rather swells and does not
lose an ounce in weight.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Observations on Pork, Curing Bacon, etc.</span></p>

<p>Hogs weighing from 150 to 200 pounds are the most suitable
size for family use. They should not exceed twelve months in
age, as they are much more tender from being young. They
should be well kept and should be corn-fed several weeks before
being killed. After being properly dressed, they should hang
long enough to get rid of the animal heat. When they are
ready to be cut up, they should be divided into nine principal
parts, two hams, two shoulders, two middlings, the head or face,
jowl and chine. The hog is laid on its back to be cut up. The
head is cut off just below the ears, then it is split down on each
side of the backbone, which is the chine. This is divided into
three pieces, the upper portion being a choice piece to be eaten
cold. The fat portion may be cut off to make lard. Each half
should then first have the leaf fat taken out, which is done by
cutting the thin skin between it and the ribs, when it is easily
pulled out. Just under this, the next thing to be removed is
the mousepiece or tenderloin, lying along the edge, from which
the backbone was removed, commencing at the point of the
ham. This is considered the most delicate part and is used to
make the nicest sausage. Just under this tenderloin are some
short ribs about three inches long, running up from the point of
the ham which are known as the griskin. This is removed by a
sharp knife being run under it, taking care to cut it smooth and
not too thick. When broiled, it is as nice as a partridge.</p>

<p>The ribs are next taken out of the shoulder and middling,
though some persons prefer leaving them in the middling. In
this case seven should be taken from the shoulder, by a sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
knife cutting close to the ribs, which make a delicious broil.
Then cut off the ham as near the bone as possible, in a half
circle. The shoulder is then cut square across just behind the
leg. The feet are then chopped off with a sharp axe or cleaver.
From the shoulder, they should be cut off leaving a stump of
about two inches. From the ham, they should be cut off at the
joint, as smoothly as possible, and then you may proceed to salt
the meat.</p>

<p>In order to impart redness to the hams, rub on each a teaspoonful
of pulverized saltpetre before salting. If the weather
is very cold, warm the salt before applying it. First rub the
skin side well with salt and then the fleshy side, using for the
purpose a shoe-sole or leather glove. No more salt should be
used than a sufficiency to preserve the meat, as an excess hardens
the meat. A bushel of salt is sufficient for a thousand
pounds of meat. For the chine and ribs a very light sprinkling
of salt will suffice.</p>

<p>The meat as salted should be packed with the skin side down,
where it should remain from four to six weeks, according to the
weather. If the weather is mild, four weeks will answer.
Should the weather be very cold and the pork in an exposed
place, it will freeze, and the salt, failing to penetrate the meat,
will be apt to injure it.</p>

<p>After it has taken salt sufficiently, the old Virginia mode is
to break the bulk, shake off the salt, rub the joint pieces (hams
and shoulders) with good, green-wood ashes (hickory preferred).
Then rebulk it and let it remain two weeks longer, when it
should be hung up with the joints down and the other pieces
may be hung up for smoking at the same time. It is not necessary
that the smoke-house should be very tight, but it is important
that the pork should not be very close to the fire.</p>

<p>A smothered fire made of small billets of wood or chips (hickory
preferred), or of corn cobs, should be made up three times

green-wood ashes, as in salt, where they will remain all the summer
without danger of bugs interfering with them.</p>

<p>This recipe has been obtained from an old Virginia family,
famous for their skill in this department of housekeeping.
This mode of curing makes the best bacon in the world, far
superior to what are generally called Virginia cured hams.</p>

<p>Shoat (which I must explain to the uninitiated is a term applied
in the South to a young pig past the age when it may be
cooked whole) should be kept up and fattened on buttermilk,
several weeks before being killed, as this makes the flesh extremely
delicate. It is best killed when between two and three
months old. It should then be divided into four quarters. It
is more delicate and wholesome eaten cold.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Pork Steak.</span></p>

<p>Remove the skin, beat without breaking into holes; scald
with boiling water, wipe dry and broil. When brown lay in a

<p>Grate over all hard biscuit or crackers that have been browned

<p class="recipe"><i>Spare-Ribs.</i></p>

<p>Cut them into pieces of two or three ribs each; put them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>

Just before you take them out, add salt, pepper, and minced
parsley.</p>

<p>Put on the cover and simmer until well seasoned.</p>

<p>Take them out of the pan, drain and dry them. For one
moment let them scorch on a gridiron over a bed of hot coals;
lay on a hot dish; butter each one; pepper added; sift over
browned cracker and serve.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cook Spare-ribs and Griskin or Short-ribs.</span></p>

<p>Put them on in a small quantity of water and boil for fifteen

pepper and put them on a hot gridiron as near the fire as possible;
broil quickly, but not too brown. Have some butter
melted and pour over the meat and shut it up in the dish.
These are good for breakfast.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cook Backbone or Chine.</span></p>

<p>Cut the chine in three pieces; the large end must be about
a foot long, the remainder cut in half. Put it in a pot of
water and boil for two hours; then put it in a pan, baste and
set it in the stove to brown. Peel some Irish potatoes and put
them in the pot; boil till done, mash them up and season with
pepper, a little salt, and some of the gravy dripping out of the
chine while baking; spread them in the dish, then lay the chine
on top. The largest piece is generally put aside to eat cold,
and is very nice. Turnips are good, cooked in the same way as
potatoes, with the chine.</p>

<p>The chine and ham of a hog are nice, corned like beef.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Backbone Pie.</span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cook a Ham of Pork.</span></p>

<p>Wash off the salt and put it in a pot of water; boil from
four to six hours, according to size. Do not take off the skin,
as it preserves the juice and is much better cold. It is also
nice to slice and broil with pepper and butter over it.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Leg of Pork Stuffed.</span></p>

<p>Make deep incisions in the meat parallel to the bone, trim it
so as to leave the skin longer than the flesh; then boil some potatoes,
and when they are done, mash them with a piece of butter,
cayenne pepper and salt, an onion finely chopped, and a
little rubbed sage.</p>

<p>With this dressing fill the incisions, draw the skin down and
skewer it over to keep the dressing from falling out. Season
the outside of the meat with salt, cayenne pepper and sage.</p>

<p>Roast it slowly; when done, pour the gravy in a pan, skim
off the fat and add some browned flour wet in a little cold
water, and boil up once.</p>

<p>Serve with apple or cranberry sauce.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A. M. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Dress Chine.</span></p>

<p>Rub the large end with salt and saltpetre, and it will keep
some time, or you may boil it fresh. Cut the bones of the
other end apart, sprinkle with flour and a little salt: add one
teacup of water, and stew.</p>

<p>It will make two large dishes.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Chine.</span></p>

<p>Chine should always be parboiled and stewed before roasting,
to take away the gross taste which the melted fat frying from

it gives. After this lay in the pan with one pint water in
which it was boiled, from which all the fat has been skimmed.
Put in this several whole leaves of sage, to be removed before
serving&mdash;just to get the flavor; minced onion, and parsley.</p>

<p>Baste and brown quickly that it may not dry.</p>

<p>This is only stewed chine browned.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p>Lay the meat in cold water as cut from the hog. Let it stand
three or four days, shifting the water each day. Scrape it and
let it stand a day or two longer, changing the water often, and if
it should turn warm, pour a little salt in the water. The oftener
it is scraped, the whiter will be the souse. Boil in plenty
of water to cover it, replenishing when needed. When tender
enough, put it in milk-warm water, and when cold in salt water.
Boil the head until the bones will almost fall out. Clean one
dozen or more ears and boil also; while hot, chop very fine, and
season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Put in a mold or bowl with a weight on top. The feet may
be soused whole, or cut up with the head and ears; but it is
not so nice. Clean them by dipping in boiling water and scraping;
do not hold them to the fire to singe off the hair. One

covered in water until you are ready to clean them, which should
be done as soon as possible, as they will be much whiter. To
get the hoof off, put the feet in hot water (not above the hoof);
as soon as they get hot enough, slip a knife between the foot
and hoof, and slip it off; then scrape the foot nicely, and throw
into a tub of clear water; do this for several days. When you
have scraped and changed the water for a week, then wash them
clean and put them on to boil. First put them in a clean pot
with a thin gruel made of corn meal; boil until half done.
Wash them off, and put on in clear hot water, and boil till done,
then take them up and throw them into a firkin of clean salt
and water; keep closely covered to prevent them from molding.
They are now ready to fry, which should be done by splitting
the foot in half and fried in egg batter.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cure Lard.</span></p>

<p>As soon as it is taken from the hog, cut in small pieces, wash
clean, press out the water, and put in the pot to boil, with one
gallon of water to a vessel holding four gallons. Boil briskly
until nearly done, or until the cracklins begin to brown, then
cook slowly to prevent burning. The cracklins should be of a
light brown and crisp, and will sink to the bottom when done.
This is Leaf Lard.</p>

<p>The fat off of the backbone is also very nice, done in the same
way, and does not require soaking, unless bloody. The fat from
the entrails can also be made into nice lard by soaking for a day
or two in fresh water, changing it frequently, and throwing a
handful of salt in the tub of water to draw out the blood and
impurities. When ready to render, wash in warm water twice
and boil in more water than you do for leaf lard. The cracklins
will not become crisp, but remain soft, and will sink to
the bottom; they are used for making soap.</p>

<p>Pack the meat in salt and allow it to remain five weeks.
Then take the hams up, wash off, and wipe dry. Have some
sacks made of about seven-eighths shirting, large enough to hold
the hams and tie above the hock. Make a pot of sizing of
equal portions of flour and corn meal, boil until thick, and dip
each sack until the outside is well coated with sizing. Put
the hams in bags, and tie tight with a strong twine and hang by

<p class="recipe"><i>To Boil Ham.</i></p>

<p>The day before you wish to boil a ham, scrape, wash and
wipe it dry, and put it in the sun. At night put it into water
and soak till next morning. Then lay it with the skin down
in a boiler of cold water, and boil slowly for five hours. If the
ham is large, boil six hours. When perfectly done and tender,
set the boiler aside, with the ham and liquor undisturbed, until
cold. Then take off the skin, sprinkle black pepper over
thickly, and sift over crackers first browned and pounded; for
special occasions, place at equal distances over the ham, scraped
horseradish in lozenge shape, and edged with curled parsley.
This mode keeps the ham juicy.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Baked Ham.</span></p>

<p>First of all, soak an old ham overnight, having first washed
and scraped it. Next morning put in a boiler of milk-warm
water with the skin side down. Boil slowly for four or five
hours, according to size, and if a very large ham, six hours.
When done, set aside the boiler with the ham and liquor in it,
to remain until cold, when the skin must be taken off, and it
must be trimmed of a nice shape. Sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls
black pepper. Lay the ham on a grating or twist in the
baking-pan, in which pour a pint of water, and set it in a hot
oven. This mode prevents the frying so disagreeable to the
taste. After the ham is heated through, and the pepper strikes
in, sift over cracker; return to the oven and brown, then decorate
with scraped horseradish and parsley, and serve.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

when hot through, lay on a dish, and pepper well. Pour over
fresh butter melted, and serve. If a raw ham is used, the
slices must be cut thicker, dropped in a pan of boiling water for
a few minutes, then broiled as above.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Fried Ham.</span></p>

<p>The slices are always taken from a raw ham, but are most
delicate when first simmered a short time: five minutes in a
stewpan, dried with a clean cloth and put in a hot frying-pan,
first removing the skin. The pan must be hot enough to
scorch and brown both ham and gravy quickly. Lay the
slices on a hot dish, pour into the gravy half a teacup new

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Shoulder of Bacon.</span></p>

half an hour; if you boil too long, it will turn yellow. It is
also good broiled for breakfast with pepper and butter over it.</p>

<p>The jaw-bone should be removed before sending to the table;
this is easily done by running a knife around the lip and under

it one tablespoonful saltpetre for every 100 pounds meat and
return it to the barrel. Let it stand one month, then take out

rare. Grate some bread crumbs over it and serve.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Barbecue Shoat.</span></p>

<p>Lay the shoat in water till ready for use; if small, it will

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Shoat Jowl.</span></p>

<p>The upper half of the head is what is generally used for
what is called "The Pig's-head Stew." Another nice dish may
be made of the under jaw or jowl by parboiling until the jaw-bone
can be taken out; always adding pepper and salt just
before it is done. When perfectly tender, score across; pepper
and salt again, cover with beaten egg, then with cracker. Set
in a pan with some of the water in which it was boiled. Put
in a hot oven and brown.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Pig.</span></p>

<p>When roasted whole, a pig should not be under four nor over
six weeks old. In town, the butcher prepares for roasting,
but it is well to know, in the country, how this may be done.
As soon as the pig is killed, throw it into a tub of cold water,
to make it tender; as soon as cold, take it by the hind leg, and
plunge into scalding, not boiling water (as the last cooks the
skin so that the hair can with difficulty be removed), shake it
about until the hair can be removed by the handful. When all
that is possible has been taken off in this way, rub from the
tail up to the end of the nose with a coarse cloth. Take off
the hoofs, scrape and wash the ears and nose until perfectly
clean. The nicest way to dress it is to hang it by the hind
legs, open and take out the entrails; wash well with water,
with a little soda dissolved in it; rinse again and again, and
leave hanging an hour. Wrap in a coarse cloth wrung out of
cold water and lay on ice or in a cool cellar until next morning,
when, if the weather is warm, it must be cooked. It should
never be used the same day that it is killed.</p>

<p>First prepare the stuffing of the liver, heart and haslets of
the pig, stewed, seasoned, and chopped. Mix with these an
equal quantity of boiled potatoes mashed; add a large spoonful
of butter, with some hard-boiled eggs, parsley and thyme,
chopped fine, pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Scald the pig on the inside, dry it and rub with pepper and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
salt, fill and sew up. Bend the fore legs under the body, the
hind legs forward, under the pig, and skewer to keep in position.
Place in a large baking-pan, pour over one quart of boiling
water. Have a lump of fresh butter tied up in a clean rag;
rub it all over the pig, then sprinkle over pepper and salt, putting
some in the pan with a bunch of herbs; invert over it a
baking-pan while it simmers, and steam until entirely done. Underdone
pork, shoat, or pig, is both unpalatable and unwholesome.
Remove the pan, rub over with the butter and baste
often. When of a fine brown, cover the edges of a large dish
with a deep fringe of curled parsley; first sift over the pig powdered
cracker, then place it, kneeling, in the green bed. Place
in its mouth an orange or a red apple; and, if eaten hot, serve
with the gravy in a tureen or sauce-boat. It is much nicer
cold; served with little mounds of grated horseradish amongst
the parsley.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Stew Pig's Head and Jowl.</span></p>

<p>Clean the head and feet; take out the bone above the nose;
cut off the ears, clean them nicely. Separate the jowl from the
head; take care of the brains to add to the stew. Put the head,
jowl, feet and part of the liver in water sufficient to keep
well covered; boil until quite done. Split the feet to put on
the dish; hash the head and liver; but do not spoil the jowl,
which must be put in the middle of the dish and surrounded
with the feet and hash. Put all of the hash, jowl and feet in
the pot and season with a cup of cream, a lump of butter, pepper
and salt, a tablespoonful walnut catsup, an onion chopped
fine, a stalk of celery.</p>

<p>A teaspoonful mustard improves it.</p>

some grated bread crumbs or crackers and butter.</p>

<p>Sew up the head and bind it with thread; put it in the pot
with the water it has been parboiled in and let it stew slowly.
Take up the head, and add to the gravy a lump of butter, rolled

<h2>BEEF AND VEAL.</h2>

<p>In selecting beef, see that the flesh is firm and of a clear red,
and the fat of a yellowish white. In buying a quarter of beef,
it is better to have it cut up by the butcher, if you are living
in town. The hind quarter is considered better, and sells higher
than the fore quarter. If a roasting piece is desired, the sirloin
from the hind quarter is usually preferred. It is not generally
known, however, that the second cut of the rib-roast from the
fore quarter is the finest roast from the beef.</p>

<p>When the bone has been removed, and the meat skewered in
the shape of a round, by the butcher, it is well to roast it on a
spit before an open fire. If the latter cannot be obtained, however,
plunge the beef for a moment in boiling water, then rub
well with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and place on a
little grate or trivet which will readily go in a baking-pan. In
this pour about a pint of the water in which the beef was
scalded. Place it in a very hot oven, with an inverted tin
plate on top of the roast. Remove this plate often to baste
the meat. When nearly done, which will be in about two
hours for a roast of six pounds, baste several times and bake a
nice brown. Season the gravy with minced onion, parsley and
thyme, add a little salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of the
meat flavoring of which a receipt was given in the general directions
about meat. Serve the gravy in a sauce-tureen, so that
each person may choose whether to eat the beef with gravy or
with the juice that escapes from the meat while it is being
carved. The latter mixed with grated horseradish is preferred
to gravy by some persons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Every portion of the beef, from head to feet, is useful and
delicious when properly prepared.</p>

<p>The rounds and rump pieces are generally used for beef <i>à la mode</i>.</p>

<p>Fresh beef from the ribs, boiled with turnips, is considered
a nice dish by some persons.</p>

<p>For steak, nothing is so nice as tenderloin or porter-house
steak. I take this occasion to protest against the unwholesome
custom of frying steak in lard. When inconvenient to broil, it
may be deliciously cooked by being first beaten till tender, then
laid in a hot frying-pan, closely covered, and cooked without
lard or butter, in its own juices. When scorched brown on
both sides, but not hard, remove the pan from the fire, pepper
and salt the steak, and put a large tablespoonful of fresh butter
on it. Press this in with a knife and fork, turning the steak,
so that each side may absorb the butter. Serve on a hot dish.
The whole process will not consume five minutes. Some persons
think it best to add the salt after the steak is done, though
many good housekeepers salt and pepper the steak before
broiling it. Beefsteak should be cooked rare; it is a
great mistake to cook it till hard and indigestible.</p>

<p>The parts most suitable for soup are the head, neck, shank,
and all the unsightly parts. After the bones are broken and
the meat boiled from them, the liquor is used for soup, while
the meat, picked or cut to pieces, will make an excellent stew
seasoned with potatoes, turnips, sweet herbs, one tablespoonful
of butter and the same of meat flavoring.</p>

<p>It is well always to keep brine on hand for corning beef.
All the parts not desirable for roast or steak had better be
corned.</p>

<p>The beef, after being dressed, should be hung up by the hind
legs, with a smooth, round piece of timber sufficiently strong
to hold the weight, passed through the legs at the hock, or run
between the tendon and bone, with short pegs to keep the legs
stretched apart. Then with a sharp axe, standing behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
suspended beef, split it down the backbone, severing it in half.
Then pass a knife through the ribs, leaving two or three short
ribs on the hind-quarter. Sever the backbone with an axe.
Then cut with a sharp knife straight across the parallel line
with the spinal bone, which piece must be divided into two
pieces, the sirloin and steak. Then take off two rounds, or
three, according to the size of the animal, cutting with a sharp
knife, and cutting the bone with a meat saw or axe, as near the
joints as possible, which leaves the shin-bone.</p>

<p>The fore quarter then is divided into four pieces, after taking
off the shoulder, which may be divided into three or more
pieces.</p>

<p>The loin of veal is the nicest part, and is always roasted.</p>

<p>The fillets and knuckles may be stewed and roasted.</p>

<p>The latter is nicest for soup.</p>

<p>The breast may be stewed or roasted.</p>

<p>The cutlets are nicest from the legs or fillet.</p>

<p>The head is a dish for soup, stew or pie.</p>

<p>Sweetbreads from the throat make a delicious dish, much
prized by epicureans.</p>

<p>The feet, boiled till the bones drop out, make a delightful
dish, fried in batter, while the water in which they are boiled
makes excellent jelly.</p>

<p>Veal, to be eaten in its perfection, should be killed when from
four to six weeks old.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beef.</span></p>

<p>The sirloin, or fore and middle ribs, are best for roasting.</p>

<p>The steaks are best cut from the ribs, or the inner part of
the sirloin; shank, tail and head make nice soup.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Roast Beef.</span></p>

<p>Lay the meat on some sticks in a dripping-pan or other vessel,
so that it will not touch the water which it is necessary to
have in the bottom. Season with salt and pepper, and put in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the oven three or four hours before it is wanted for the table.
Baste it often with the water in the bottom of the pan, renewing
it as often as it gets low. This makes sweet, juicy roast
beef. The great secret of it is, not to have the meat touch the
water in the bottom of the pan, and to baste it often. Tough,
unpromising pieces of beef are best cooked by steaming them
an hour and a half or so and then putting them in the oven
and roasting as much longer.</p>

<p>Crackers, first browned and then pounded, should always be
kept to sift over roast meats: and curled parsley to garnish
with. Grated horseradish is also excellent with the roast.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Rib Roast of Beef.</span></p>

<p>Get, from the butcher, a rib-roast&mdash;the second cut is best&mdash;and
get him to take out the bones, and roll and skewer it: if
this is not convenient, it can be done at home with a sharp
knife. Before roasting, take out the wooden skewers put in at
market, unroll, season well with salt and pepper and anything
else liked, and roll again tightly, fastening securely with the
iron skewer pins. Put it in a pan on a little iron griddle or
trivet, made for the purpose to keep it just over the pint of
water in the pan. Pepper and salt freely, dredge with flour
and baste. Some persons like half a teacup of pepper vinegar,
poured over just before it is done; and minced onion, thyme
and parsley added to the gravy, which should be brown.&mdash;<i>Mrs. B.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Roast Beef.</span></p>

<p>The sirloin is the nicest for the purpose.</p>

<p>Plunge the beef in boiling water and boil for thirty minutes:
then put it in the stove-pan; skim the top of the water in
which it has been boiled, and baste the roast, after dredging it
with flour; pepper and salt to taste. Baste frequently, and
roast till done.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beef à la Mode.</span></p>

<p>Take, from a round of fresh beef, the bone; beat the meat

<p>Mix these ingredients with three eggs well beaten: fill the
place from whence came the bone, and what is left rub all over
the round: fasten well with a tape, tied round to keep in
shape. Cover the pan with slices of bacon, lay the beef upon
them, baste with butter: pour in the pan a pint of water.
Cover closely and stew gently for six hours; when thoroughly
done, take out the beef, skim the fat from the gravy, strain into
a saucepan, set it on the stove and stir into it one teacup Port
wine. Let it come to a boil and send to the table in a sauce
tureen. You may, for supper, dish cold: dress with vegetable
flowers, whites of eggs boiled hard and chopped fine.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J. W. S.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Beef à la Mode.</i></p>

<p>Take a round or a rump piece of beef, take out the bone, the
gristle and all the tough pieces about the edges. Fill the cavities
from which the bone was taken, with suet, and fat salt
pork.</p>

<p>Press this so as to make it perfectly round, pass around a
coarse, strong piece of cloth, so as to hold it firmly in shape.
If the round is six inches thick, the cloth must be six inches
wide, leaving the top and bottom open. With a larding needle,
fill this thickly with strips of fat pork, running through from
top to bottom and about one inch apart each way. Set this in
a baking-pan, pour over:</p>

<div class="block-container">

<p>Sprinkle over the beef liberally with salt and black pepper;
chop one small onion fine, and lay over top of the beef. Simmer
this for two or three hours, basting frequently and keeping
an inverted tin plate over the beef except when basting. If the
gravy stews down too much, add stock or broth of any kind.
Turn it over, and let the top be at the bottom. When it is
done and tender, skim the fat from the gravy. Pour over:</p>

<p>Simmer and bake for two hours longer, frequently basting,
that it may be soft and seasoned through and through. Take the

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Broiled Steak.</span></p>

<p>A porter-house steak is considered, by some persons, best,

knife and fork profusely butter, with one large tablespoonful
fresh butter, turning and pressing it so as to absorb the butter;
pepper again and set the dish over boiling water until wanted,
when it will be found tender and juicy, if not cooked too long
on a gridiron. One tablespoonful pepper vinegar gives this the

made mustard, for those who like highly seasoned food.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">How to Cook Beefsteak.</span></p>

<p>Take a thin, long-handled frying-pan, put it on the stove and
heat it quite hot. In this put the pieces of steak previously
pounded, but do not put a particle of butter in the frying-pan
and do not salt the steak. Allow the steak to merely glaze over
and then turn it quickly to the other side, turning it several
times in this manner, until it is done. Four minutes is sufficient
for cooking. When done, lay it on the platter, previously
warmed; butter and salt, and set a moment in the hot oven.
Allow the steak to heat but a moment on each side; this helps
it to retain all its sweet juices, and putting on the salt at the
last moment, after it is on the platter, draws out its juices.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Fried with Onions.</span></p>

<p>Have ready a hot frying-pan, lay in the steak and cover
closely. The juice of the meat will be sufficient to cook it.
Turn often, as the pan must be hot enough to scorch and make
the steak and gravy brown.</p>

<p>Before it gets hard or overdone, butter liberally; place in a

out the blood; drain and put them in a saucepan and pour very
little boiling water on; simmer a few minutes. Handle them
lightly, and arrange so as to form round cakes, without breaking.
Pepper them and use very little salt; brains require very
little salt. Have ready a beaten egg, and cover the top of the
cakes with it, using a spoon to put it on. Sift over grated
cracker and fry in hot lard; serve the other side the same way.
Keep closely covered while frying.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Prepare Tripe.</span></p>

<p>Empty the contents of the stomach of a fat beef; put it in
boiling water, one piece at a time, to prevent getting too hot.
Scrape with a sharp knife, then put it in a vessel of cold water
with salt; wash thoroughly, and change the salt water every day
for four or five consecutive days; when perfectly white, boil in
a very clean vessel of salt water. Then put it in vinegar until
you wish to use it. Cut it in pieces of three or four inches
square, and fry in egg batter.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J. H.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Tripe.</span></p>

<p>The moment the tripe is taken out, wash it thoroughly in
many cold waters. (If you have quick-lime, sift it over the
dark inner coat, and instantly scrape off the coat.) Cut it in
four parts. Have ready boiling water, dip and scrape until it
becomes quite white. Prepare weak brine with a considerable
mixture of meal; let it soak a day. Continue to shift it every
day, and every other day scrape it; this must be done for a
week, and then make nice gruel, in which it must be well
boiled, first tying it up in a cloth. When boiled, take it out
of the cloth, and lay it in a weak brine for a night, after which
it may be put with the feet.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beef Tripe.</span></p>

<p>Clean the tripe carefully. Soak several days in salt water,

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Fry Tripe.</span></p>

<p>Cut the tripe after it has been boiled, into strips about four
inches wide and six long. Make a batter with two eggs, one
teacup of flour and a little milk. Pepper the tripe and roll it
in the batter. Fry in a pan of hot lard; as soon as one side
is done, turn it over on the other side.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Gravy for Roast Beef.</span></p>

<p>When the joint is done to a turn, dish it and place before
the fire; then carefully remove the fat from the dripping-pan,
and pour the gravy into the dish, not over the meat, as is the
custom of inexperienced cooks, who, moreover, ruthlessly drown
it with a cupful of boiling water or highly flavored made-gravy.
This is an error, for there is always a sufficient quantity of
natural gravy in good meat to render the use of foreign sauces
superfluous.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Brown Gravy.</span></p>

<p>Take the gravy that drips from the meat; add a little water,

care as the water boils away to replenish with boiling water.
Have ready strong brine, not boiled nor strong enough to bear
an egg, and the moment the feet are stripped, throw them in.
Let them stand one night and in the morning pour the brine
from them and put to them a fresh brine, with a small quantity
of vinegar. In a day or two, they are fit for use.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p>Stew it long enough to cook the flour. Pour into a deep dish,

for several days.&mdash;<i>Mrs. H. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cure Beef for Drying.</span></p>

<p>This recipe keeps the meat moist, so that it has none of that
toughness dried beef mostly has when a little old. To every
twenty-eight or thirty pounds, allow one tablespoonful saltpetre,
one quart fine salt, mixed with molasses until the color is about
that of light brown sugar; rub the pieces of meat with the mixture,
and when done, let all stick to it that will. Pack in a keg
or half-barrel, that the pickle may cover the meat, and let it
remain forty-eight hours; at the end of that time, enough pickle
will be formed to cover it. Take it out and hang in a suitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
place for drying. Allow all the mixture to adhere to the meat
that will.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A. M. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cure Beef Ham.</span></p>

<p>Divide the ham into three parts; rub on half-pint molasses;
let it remain in this molasses a day and two nights, turning it
over occasionally during the time. Rub on then one handful
salt and put it back in the vessel with the molasses; turn it
over, morning and night for ten days. Hang it up to dry for
one week, then smoke a little. It is an excellent plan, after sufficiently
smoked, to put each piece of beef in a bag, to protect
from insects, and keep hanging till used.&mdash;<i>Miss K. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Dry Beef and Tongue.</span></p>

<p>The best pieces are the brisket, the round and rib pieces that
are used for roasting. Put about the middle of February in
brine. Rub first with salt, and let them lie for a fortnight, then
throw them in brine and let them lay there three weeks, take
them out and wipe dry: rub them over with bran and hang in
a cool place and dark, not letting them touch anything. Should
there come a wet season, put them in the sun to dry a little.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Stewed Loin of Veal.</span></p>

<p>Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do. Put it
into a large, thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stew-pan,
add about two ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire
until it begins to brown; flour the veal well over, lay it in a
saucepan, and when it is of a fine, equal light brown, pour gradually
in veal broth, gravy or boiling water, to nearly half its
depth; add a little salt, one or two sliced carrots, a small onion,
or more when the flavor is liked, and one bunch parsley.</p>

<p>Stew the veal very softly for an hour or rather more, then
turn it and let it stew for nearly or quite another hour or
longer, should it not appear perfectly done. A longer time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
must be allowed when the meat is more than middling size.
Dish the joint; skim all the fat from the gravy and strain it
over the meat, or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced
to a richer consistency.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Veal Chops.</span></p>

<p>First beat until tender, then lay the chops in a pan, pour in
just enough boiling water to barely cover them. Cover closely
and simmer till tender, sprinkling over after they are nearly
done, with a little pepper and salt. Lift from the pan, dry with
a clean towel, butter them, then cover with beaten egg, and sift
on cracker crumbs. Lay on a baking dish or pan and set in the
stove to brown. Garnish and serve.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Veal.</span></p>

<p>Plunge into boiling water, dry with a clean cloth; rub well
with pepper and salt, then with butter. Dredge with flour,
and put into a pan with two teacups of boiling water, a slice of
bacon or pork, minced onion and parsley, pepper and salt. Set
in a hot oven; simmer, baste and brown. Veal is longer cooking
than lamb. When a light brown, with a pin, stick on
a buttered paper to prevent dryness. Thicken the gravy with
brown flour, if brown gravy is wanted, but always with mashed
Irish potato if white gravy is desired.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Veal Steak.</span></p>

<p>First beat until it is tender, then without washing lay on a
gridiron over coals; turn over it a tin plate to prevent hardness
and dryness. Turn the steak, and when well done, with a knife
and fork press it and turn it in a pan or plate of hot melted
butter. After putting in plate of hot butter and letting it
absorb as much of the butter as possible, lay it on a dish, pepper
and salt it plentifully, and pour over the melted butter.
(Set in the oven a few minutes, but not long enough for the
butter to fry, which is ruinous to the flavor of steaks, game,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
etc.) When done, sift over grated cracker. Garnish with parsley
and serve hot.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlet.</span></p>

<p>Cut the veal as if for steak or frying, put lard or butter in
the pan, and let it be hot. Beat up an egg on a plate and have
flour on another; dip the pieces first in the egg, then in the
flour, on both sides, and lay in the pan and fry until done, turning
it carefully once. This makes an excellent dish if well prepared.
This way is superior to batter.&mdash;<i>Mrs. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Veal Cutlet.</i></p>

<p>Cut it in pieces the size of your hand, and lay in salt water
some little time. Take out and wipe dry. Put a small piece
of lard in the pan and sprinkle the cutlet with a very little
flour, pepper, and salt. Fry until nearly done. When it
begins to brown, pour off the lard, and pour in a little water,
one large spoonful butter, and a little celery-seed. Turn it over
frequently.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Veal Cutlets.</i></p>

<p>Trim smoothly and beat till tender, sprinkle over pepper
and salt; then with a spoon spread over an egg beaten till
thick, and cover thickly with pounded cracker.</p>

<p>Have some hot lard ready in the frying-pan, put the cutlets on
to fry, with the prepared side down; when of a light yellow
brown, dress the other side the same way and fry, keeping
closely covered. When they are perfectly done (veal should
never be rare), place in a hot dish; pour one teacup of
milk, one small piece of butter, pepper, salt, and minced onion
and parsley into the pan, stirring constantly. When it boils
up, pour into the dish and garnish with parsley. Always sift
browned cracker over such dishes.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i>

<p>Have the yolk of an egg well beaten up, and add to the meat,
also a piece of butter.</p>

<p>Let it boil up once, stirring all the time, and serve it on

<h2>MUTTON AND LAMB.</h2>

<p>When the weather will admit of it, mutton is better for
being kept a few days before cooking. The saddle, which is
considered the finest piece, consists of the back or loin and
upper part of the hind legs. In getting this nice roast, however,
you spoil the hind quarter, as the saddle takes some of the
nicest parts of this and leaves it too dry to cook by itself. The
hind quarter and loin together make a very nice dish&mdash;the
latter being fat and juicy.</p>

<p>The fore quarter is sometimes cut by taking off the shoulder
and taking the rib-piece, making a piece called the brisket or
breast, and many persons esteem this the choicest part of the
mutton. The ribs cut next to the back are used for mutton
chops.</p>

<p>When you have a large supply of mutton on hand, it is well
to put the hind quarters in brine, as you can thus corn them as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
nicely as beef. As mutton spoils easily, this plan is very advisable.</p>

<p>Whilst boiled mutton is very nice, lamb is spoiled by this
mode of cooking. If lamb is to be roasted, it should be covered
with the caul, as the fat, dripping from this, will preserve
the moisture of the meat.</p>

<p>In carving the fore quarter of lamb, first take off the shoulder
and then cut the ribs in strips.</p>

<p>Lamb is seldom cut except in quarters, and when nicely cooked
there is nothing better. It should be four months old before
being eaten. The season for lamb is from May to August,
whilst that for mutton is from August to Christmas.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Roast Mutton.</span></p>

<p>The hind quarter is the nicest part of the mutton to roast, and
requires longer to cook than lamb. Put it in a pot of boiling
water and let it simmer one hour. Lift it into a baking-pan,
rub with salt and pepper (too much salt makes the meat tough).
Rub over it a little lard and then dredge with flour: skim off
the top of the water and pour over it. Set it in a hot oven,
basting frequently to prevent it from being hard and dry; roast
till thoroughly done. This is nice to set aside for a cold dish,
garnished with horseradish and eaten with currant jelly.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Leg of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Choose young and tender mutton. Take off the shank&mdash;wash
it well; let it lie fifteen or twenty minutes in salt water to
take the blood out. Rub with little salt and pepper well.
Lay on a grate, which will go nicely in a baking-pan, over one
pint boiling water; break the bones of the shank in the water,
adding more pepper and salt. Set it in a very hot oven, and
baste frequently to prevent it from being hard and dry. When
it is of a light brown, cover with sheets of buttered paper.
Place it on a dish; add minced parsley to the gravy, which
should be brown. Cover the roast with grated brown cracker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and garnish at intervals with chopped parsley; pour the gravy
in the dish, not over it. Mutton should always be perfectly
done.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Saddle of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Trim the joint carefully, roast it at a brisk, clear fire; baste
frequently, and when done dredge it plentifully with salt, and
serve with the gravy well freed from fat.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Boil a Leg of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Make a paste of flour quite plain, mixed stiff with water, roll
out as for a meat pudding; break and turn in the shank bone;
then cover the leg of mutton carefully with the paste; tie up
tight in a well-floured cloth. Have ready sufficient boiling
water, place in the joint, allow ten minutes for checking the
boiling, and twenty minutes for each pound of meat. Carefully
remove the paste, which can be done by one cut longitudinally
and one cut across. Strain the gravy and serve as usual.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Boiled Leg of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Dip a cloth in hot water, tie up the mutton and put in boiling
water. Boil slowly for two hours, or longer, if not kept
constantly boiling.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Broiled Mutton.</span></p>

<p>After a leg of mutton has been washed and wiped dry, place
in a cloth that has been dipped in boiling water. Roll it up, pin
and tie securely; put in a pot of boiling water. Let it simmer
several hours, removing the scum that rises when it first begins
to boil. If a small leg of mutton, it will require a shorter time
to cook than a large one. Just before it is done, add enough salt
to season it properly, half an onion, and one heaping teaspoonful
of black pepper. When this has properly seasoned the meat, take
from the fire, unwrap and drain. Serve with drawn butter,
adding capers or nasturtium seed, or if you have neither, use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
chopped sour pickle instead. Mutton should always be served
with caper sauce, if possible.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Cook a Saddle of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Meats are all better for being kept a day or two before cooking,
particularly mutton. If the mutton be tender, do not boil it,
but put it in a pan of water, set it on the stove, and cook
slowly, basting constantly with the gravy or water in the pan;
with pepper and salt to taste. Just before it is done, put some
scraped horseradish over it, and garnish the dish with the
same; add a little ground mustard and grated bread or cracker;
pour the gravy over it, and grate bread over, and set aside to
cool. This is for cold mutton. All meats are better for roasting
before a fire than in a stove.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Saddle of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>This should be covered with paper, and carefully roasted or
baked. Season with a little pepper and salt; garnish with
horseradish.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Iced Saddle of Mutton.</span></p>

<p>Reserve the drippings from the meat when it is roasting.
After the saddle is nicely cooked, let it get cold. Then take
the white part of the gravy and melt it to the consistency of
cream. Pour this over the saddle until it is covered with a
white coat; if it appears rough, warm an iron spoon and pass
over it until it is smooth. Place it on a dish, and dress the
dish all round with vegetable flowers and curled parsley, using
the parsley to ornament the saddle also.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Judge S.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Corn Mutton.</span></p>

<h2>POULTRY.</h2>

<p>In summer, kill and dress the poultry the day beforehand,
except chicken for frying, which is not good unless killed the
same day it is eaten.</p>

<p>The best way to kill a fowl is to tie it by its legs, hang it up,
and then cut off its neck. In this way, it dies more quickly,
suffers less, and bleeds more freely.</p>

<p>It is best to pick fowls dry; though, if you are pressed for
time, you may facilitate the picking of chickens, as well as of
partridges and other small birds, by putting them first into
water, hot, but not boiling. Then take off the feathers carefully,
so as not to break the skin. Never scald a turkey, duck or
goose, however, before picking.</p>

<p>To draw the crop, split the skin of all poultry on the back of
the neck. Pull the neck upward and the skin downward, and
the crop can be easily pulled out. Then cut off the neck close
to the body, leaving the skin to skewer at the back of the neck
after the dressing has been put in. Make an incision under
the rump lengthwise, sufficient to allow the entrails to be easily
removed. Be careful not to break the gall, and to preserve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
liver whole. Cut open the gizzard, take out the inner skin,
and wash both carefully. Wash the bird inside several times,
the last time with salt and water. Some persons object to
using water inside or outside, but I consider it more cleanly to
wash the bird first and then wipe it dry with a clean towel.
It should then be hung with the neck downwards till ready to
cook.</p>

<p>The head, neck, and feet, after being nicely washed and the
bones in them broken, should be stewed in the gravy, as they
make it much richer.</p>

<p>It is said that throwing chickens into cold water immediately
after they have finished bleeding, and allowing them to remain
there ten or fifteen minutes, will make them deliciously tender,
which can be accounted for scientifically. Frozen fowls or game
should be thawed gradually, by being laid in cold water. If
cooked without being thawed, it will require double time, and
they will not be tender nor high-flavored.</p>

<p>The tests by which you may tell the age of a turkey are
these. An old turkey has rough and red legs, and if a gobbler,
long spurs, while young turkeys have black legs, and if gobblers,
small spurs. The fatter they are and the broader their breasts,
the better. When dressed, the skin should be a yellowish
white, and, if tender, you may easily rip it with a pin. If,
when you bend back the wings, the sinews give and crack,
this is another test of the turkey being young, and the same
test will apply to other fowls. The bill and feet of an old
goose are red and hairy. A young goose has pen feathers and
its flesh is whiter than that of an old one.</p>

<p>If young, the lower part of a hen's legs and feet are soft and
smooth, while a young cock has small spurs. When dressed,
the flesh should be white and the fat a pale yellow. Turn the
wing back, and if the sinews snap it is a sign the chicken is
young.</p>

<p>A few words on the subject of carving may not be out of
place here. A sharp knife, with a thin and well tempered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
blade is essential to good carving. In carving a turkey, cut off
first the wing nearest to you, then the leg and second joint,
then slice the breast till a rounded, ivory-shaped piece appears.
Insert the knife between that and the bone, and separate them.
This part is the nicest bit of the breast. Next comes the
merry-thought. After this, turn over the bird a little, and just
below the breast you will find the oyster, which you will separate
as you did the inner breast. The side bone lies beside the
rump, and the desired morsel can be taken out without separating
the whole bone. Proceed with the other side in the same
way. The fork need not be removed during the whole process.</p>

<p>Chicken and partridges are carved in the same way.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey.</span></p>

<p>Wash nicely in and out. Plunge into boiling water ten minutes.
Have ready a dressing of</p>

<div class="block-container">
<div class="ings">
<p>Bread crumbs.</p>
<p>Hard boiled eggs, chopped fine.</p>
<p>1 tablespoonful butter.</p>
<p>Minced parsley, thyme and celery.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>After rubbing the cavity well with salt and pepper and putting
in a slice of pork or bacon, fill with the above dressing.
Do the same also to the crop, so as to make the turkey look
plump. Rub the turkey well with butter and sprinkle salt and
pepper over it. Dredge with flour. Lay in the pan with a
slice of pork or bacon and a pint of boiling water. Lay the
liver and gizzard in the pan with it. Put in a hot oven, basting
and turning frequently till every part is a beautiful brown.
When the meat is amber color, pin a buttered sheet of writing
paper over it to keep it from becoming hard and dry. Cook
three or four hours. Season the gravy with minced parsley and
celery and serve with cranberry sauce.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Roast Turkey.</i></p>

<p>Wash the turkey thoroughly inside and out, having removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the insides. Make a dressing of bread soaked in cold water,
drained and mashed fine, a small piece of melted butter or
salt pork chopped, pepper and salt, sweet herbs, a hard boiled
egg, chopped fine.</p>

<p>Any kind of cooked meat is good, minced fine and added to
the dressing. The body and crop must be filled with the dressing
and sewed up. The giblets ought to be boiled tender, if
they are to be used. Use the water in which they are boiled,
for gravy, adding a little of the turkey drippings, seasoning
with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs, and thickening with a little
flour and water, mixed smoothly. Place where it will boil.</p>

<p>When the fowl is put on to roast, put a little water into the
dripping-pan. At first it should be roasted slowly and basted
frequently. Tie up the wings and legs before roasting, and rub
on a little butter and salt. Serve with drawn butter.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Roast Turkey.</i></p>

<p>Put the gizzard, heart and liver in cold water and boil till
tender. When done, chop fine and add stale bread, grated, salt
and pepper, sweet herbs, if liked, two eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>Fill the turkey with this dressing, sew the openings, drawing
the skin tightly together. Put a little butter over the turkey
and lay it upon the grate of your meat-pan. Cover the bottom
of the pan well with boiling water. In half an hour, baste the
turkey by pouring over it the gravy that has begun to form in
the pan. Repeat this basting every fifteen minutes. In an
oven of average temperature, a twelve-pound turkey will require
at least three hours' cooking.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey, with Truffles.</span></p>

<p>Truffles must be peeled, chopped and pounded in a mortar;
one and a half pound will do for one turkey. Rasp the same
amount of fat bacon and mix with the truffles and stuff the
turkey with it. This dressing is usually placed in the turkey
two days beforehand, to impart its flavor to the fowl. Lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
thin slices of fat bacon over the breast of the turkey, cover it
with half a sheet of white paper, and roast two hours. Chestnuts
dressed in the same way as truffles are found an excellent
substitute.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. G.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Boiled Turkey.</span></p>

<p>Wash well with cold water, then put on in milk-warm water,
either tied in a coarse cloth dredged with flour or with a half-pound
of rice in the water. Keep well under water, and boil
slowly three hours, adding salt just before it is done. When
perfectly done and tender, take out of the pot, sprinkle in the
cavity a little pepper and salt, and fill with oysters stewed just
enough to plump them, and season, with butter, pepper, salt
and vinegar. Place in a dish and set in a steamer to keep hot.
Strain the liquor in which the oysters were scalded, add drawn
butter, chopped celery, parsley and thyme; pour over the turkey,
and serve. If not convenient to use oysters, use egg and butter
sauce. Garnish with sliced lemons.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Turkey.</i></p>

<p>Prepare the turkey as for roasting. Tie it in a cloth or boil
rice in the pot with it, if you wish it to look white. It is improved
by boiling a pound or two of salt pork with it. If soup
is made of the liquor, let it stand till next day and skim the
fat. Season after heating.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Steam a Turkey.</span></p>

<p>Rub butter, pepper and salt inside the turkey after it has

in a steamer placed over boiling water. Cover closely and
steam from two hours to two and a half. Take up, strain the
gravy which will be found in the dish. Have an oyster sauce
ready, prepared like stewed oysters, and pour into it this gravy
thickened with a little butter and flour. Let it come to a boil
and whiten with a little boiled cream. Pour this over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Potato Stuffing for Turkeys and other Fowls.</span></p>

<p>Mash smoothly six good-sized boiled Irish potatoes. Chop a
small onion very fine and fry a light brown, in a frying-pan,
with a dessertspoonful lard. Then add the potatoes with salt
and pepper, and a lump of butter as large as a walnut. To this
add one well beaten egg, stirring till perfectly dry. If for geese
or ducks, add a little sifted sage and a small quantity of red
pepper.&mdash;<i>Mrs. McG.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Boned Turkey.</span></p>

<p>The turkey must be full grown, moderately fat, and picked
dry. Do not remove the entrails. Cut off the neck about one
inch from the body. Take off the wings above the second joint
and cut off the legs as usual. With a sharp pointed knife,
split the skin from the end of the neck to the rump. Run the
knife between the bones and flesh on one side, till you come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
where the wing and leg join the body. Twist the wing and
raise it, cracking the joint. Separate it from the body. Then
proceed with the leg in the same way, on the same side. Run
the knife between the bones and flesh till you reach the breast
bone. Repeat this on the other side. Take out the craw.
Carefully run a sharp knife under the rump, detaching it from
the bone without cutting the skin, as it must come off with the
flesh. Hold the turkey by the neck and pull the skin carefully
down, until the upper part of the breast bone is uncovered.
Cut the flesh from the bone on both sides, till the end of the
bone is nearly reached. The turkey must now be laid on the
back and held by the neck, the front of the turkey being toward
you. Take hold of the skin of the neck with the left hand,
pulling downwards with a knife in the right hand, separate the
skin from the end of the bone. The whole of the turkey is now
detached from the carcass. Lay it on a table with the skin
down. Pull the bones from the wings and legs, first running
the knife around so as to leave the flesh. Pull out all the tendons
of the legs. Push them and the wings inside. Cut off
the ring under the rump. All this must be done slowly and
carefully. Have ready a half-dozen slices of salt pork, and a
salad made of shoat, veal or lamb, chopped and seasoned, as
turkey salad, with celery, etc. Mix with this salad three or
four large Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed, with a spoonful of
butter. Now lay the turkey on the table, inside up and the
neck from you; pepper and salt it; lay three or four slices of
pork on it, then a layer of the salad; pork again and salad
alternately until filled; draw the two sides together and sew
it up, giving it as near as possible its proper shape. Sew it up
carefully in a cloth, place in a kettle of the proper shape,
cover with boiling water, adding the broken bones, three pounds
fresh lean beef, parsley, thyme, onions and two dozen whole
black peppercorns, with salt to the taste. Simmer three hours,
then take it from the water and remove the towel. Carefully
remove all discolorations and settlings of the water from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
turkey. Scald a clean cloth, wrap it up again; place it on its
back, put a dish over it with a weight on it and set it in a cool
place till next day. Unwrap and remove the twine with which
it was sewed. Glaze it with a little meat jelly; just before
the jelly congeals sift over a little cracker browned and
pounded; decorate with meat jelly and serve. Directions for
preparing meat jelly follow.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Meat Jelly for Boned Turkey.</span></p>

<p>As soon as the water in which the turkey was boiled is cold,
take off all the fat and strain it, put it in a porcelain-lined
kettle; two ounces gelatine, three eggs, with shells, a wine-glass
of sherry, port or madeira wine; stir well. Add one
quart of the strained liquor; beat rapidly with an egg-beater,
put it on the fire and stir until it boils. Simmer ten or fifteen
minutes. Sprinkle in a pinch of turmeric and strain just as
any other jelly. When congealed break it up and place around
the turkey. Cut some in thick slices and in fanciful shapes
with paste cutters. Place some of these lozenges over the
turkey and border the edges of the dish with them.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Chickens.</span></p>

<p>These, whether for boiling or roasting, should have a dressing
prepared as for turkeys. Six spoonfuls of rice boiled with
the chickens will cause them to look white. If the water is cold
when they are put in, they will be less liable to break. They
are improved by boiling a little salt pork with them. If not
thus boiled, they will need salt.</p>

<p>For broiling, chickens should be split, the innards taken out,
and the chickens then washed. Broil very slowly till done,
placing the bony side down; then turn it and brown the other
side. Forty minutes is the medium time for broiling a chicken.</p>

<p>For roast chicken, boil the gizzard and liver by themselves,
and use the water for gravy.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Col. W.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Roast Chicken.</span></p>

<p>Chicken should never be cooked the same day it is killed.
Wash well with cold water, then pour boiling water over it and

out, a tablespoonful butter, a little salt, pepper and parsley.</p>

<p>Rub the chicken well with butter. Sprinkle pepper and salt
over it and dredge with flour. Lay it into a pan with a slice of
pork or bacon and a pint of water. Let it simmer slowly two
hours, basting and dredging frequently. Turn the chicken so
each part may be equally browned. Add chopped thyme and
parsley to the gravy.</p>

<p>Some persons think ground ginger a more delicate flavoring
for the dressing than pepper.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Boil Chicken.</span></p>

<p>Never boil the same day the chicken is killed. Soak them

with a handful of rice and a little milk to make the chicken
white. Simmer slowly two or three hours, removing the scum
that rises when the chicken first begins to boil. Keep under
the water, with an inverted deep plate. Just before taking off
the fire, add salt to the taste. Lay on a hot dish near the fire.
Skim off the fat from the top of the liquor, strain it and add
chopped celery, parsley and thyme, drawn butter, a little pepper
and salt, or, if preferred, six hard-boiled eggs chopped fine.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Steam Chicken.</span></p>

<p>Soak two hours, in salt and water, a fat young pullet. Drain

Simmer an hour or more, basting frequently. When thoroughly
done, place on a hot dish.</p>

<p>Stir into the gravy remaining on the fire a beaten egg, mixing

immediately after breakfast.</p>

<p>An hour and a half before dinner, put in a saucepan, covering
well with water. Let it simmer slowly for one hour. Take
it out with a fork and lay in a bowl. Add a teacup milk and
half a teaspoonful black pepper to the liquor. Let it boil up
and strain on the chicken. Rinse the saucepan and return all
to the fire. Beat one egg with a tablespoonful of flour and one
of milk until quite smooth. Mince some parsley, thyme, and a

also the back. Wash well and throw in weak salt and water,
to extract the blood. Let it remain for half an hour or more.
Take from the water, drain and dry with a clean towel, half an
hour before dinner. Lay on a dish, sprinkle a little salt over
it, and sift flour thickly first on one side and then on the other,
letting it remain long enough for the flour to stick well. Have
ready on the frying-pan some hot lard, in which lay each piece
carefully, not forgetting the liver and gizzard. Cover closely
and fry till a fine amber color. Then turn over each piece and
cover well again, taking care to have the chicken well done,
yet not scorched. Take the chicken up and lay in a hot dish
near the fire. Pour into the gravy a teacup of milk, a teaspoonful
of butter, a saltspoon of salt, and one of pepper. Let it
boil up and pour into the dish, but not over the chicken. Put
curled parsley round the edge of the dish and serve.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p>A goose must never be eaten the same day it is killed. If

to remove the strong taste. Then plunge it in boiling water,

<h2>SALADS.</h2>

<p>In making salads, be careful to add the vinegar last. Where
oil cannot be obtained, fresh butter, drawn or melted, is an
excellent substitute and is indeed preferred to oil by some persons,
epicureans to the contrary notwithstanding. Always
use good cider vinegar in making salads, as chemical vinegar is
sometimes very unwholesome. Much depends on the rotation
in which you mix the ingredients for a salad, so I would call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
particular attention to the directions given on this point on the
subsequent pages.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Oyster Salad.</span></p>

<div class="block-container">
<div class="ings">
<p>½ gallon fresh oysters.</p>
<p>The yolks of four hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<p>1 raw egg, well whipped.</p>
<p>2 large spoonfuls salad oil or melted butter.</p>
<p>2 teaspoonfuls salt.</p>
<p>2 teaspoonfuls black pepper.</p>
<p>2 teaspoonfuls made mustard.</p>
<p>1 teacup good vinegar.</p>
<p>2 good sized pickled cucumbers, cut up fine.</p>
<p>Nearly as much celery as oysters, cut up into small dice.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters and throw them into some
hot vinegar on the fire; let them remain until they are <i>plump</i>,
not cooked. Then put them at once into clear cold water;
this gives them a nice plump look and they will not then shrink
and look small. Drain the water from them and set them away
in a cool place, and prepare your dressing. Mash the yolks as
fine as you can and rub into it the salt, pepper, and mustard,
then rub the oil in, a few drops at a time. When it is all
smooth, add the beaten egg, and then the vinegar, a spoonful at
a time. Set aside. Mix oysters, celery, and pickle, tossing up
well with a silver fork. Sprinkle in salt to your taste. Then
pour dressing over all.&mdash;<i>Mrs. E. P. G.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Salmon and Lobster Salad.</span></p>

<p>If the salmon salad is made of the fish preserved in cans,
drain it from the oil and mince the meat fine. Cut up one
third as much lettuce or celery.</p>

<p>For one box of salmon, boil four eggs hard; lay them in cold
water a few minutes, shell and separate the whites from the
yolks; lay the whites aside. Mash the yolks smooth with two
tablespoonfuls sweet olive oil or one teacup sweet rich milk or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
cream. The oil makes the smoothest and best paste. Dissolve
in one teacup vinegar,</p>

<div class="block-container">
<div class="ings">
<p>1 tablespoonful sugar.</p>
<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>
<p>2 or more teaspoonfuls fine mustard.</p>

<p>Mix this with the paste and toss lightly over the meat with
a silver fork. Ornament the dish in which it is served with
the green leaves of the celery, or with curled parsley and the
whites of eggs cut in rings.</p>

<p>Lobster salad is prepared in the same way. Take the nicest
parts of the lobster.&mdash;<i>Mrs. C. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lobster Salad.</span></p>

<p>Chop up one can of lobsters; cut in small pieces as much
celery. Then cream with one teacup butter, one tablespoonful
mustard, one tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, and
yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth; stir in five
tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar (simply pepper steeped in vinegar
and sweetened with a little sugar), and pour the mixture
over the lobster and celery.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Fish Salad.</span></p>

<p>Boil four flounders, or any medium sized fish; when done,
take off the skin and pick out the bones, then shred very fine.
Add pepper and salt, one tablespoonful mixed mustard, a half
cup vinegar, and half a pound butter, and mix all well with
the fish. Put into shallow pans, set in the oven and bake ten
minutes. When cold put over it a little Worcestershire sauce,
and sherry wine.&mdash;<i>Miss F. N.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Terrapin Salad.</span></p>

pull out; then cut into small pieces and carefully remove the
sand-bag and gall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>To three good sized terrapins, take six hard-boiled eggs; remove
the yolks and rub into a powder with half a pound sweet
butter. When creamy and light, add one teaspoonful flour.
Put this with the meat into a saucepan; season with cayenne
pepper and salt, and let it boil for one or two minutes. Just
before taking from the fire, add wine to taste, and if desired, a
little mace.</p>

<p>Yolks of three eggs, one tablespoonful vinegar, half a tablespoonful
fresh butter, a little salt.</p>

<p>To be stirred over a slow fire till it thickens, it must only
be warm or it will curdle and spoil.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Sauce for Cod's Head.</span></p>

<p>Take a lobster, stick a skewer through the tail, to keep the
water out; throw a handful of salt in the water. When it
boils put in the lobster and boil half an hour; pick off the
spawns, if any, and pound them very fine in a marble mortar
and put them in one-half pound drawn butter. Take the meat
out of the lobster, pull it in bits and put it in your butter; add:</p>

<p>Cut cold mutton into very thin slices, and make a gravy by
boiling the bones for two hours with a little onion, pepper and
salt.</p>

<p>Strain this gravy and thicken it with a little flour, adding a
small amount of tomato or mushroom gravy to flavor it, and
a small piece of butter. When the gravy is of a proper consistency,
put in the slices of mutton, and let it simmer slowly
for ten minutes. Serve on a platter with parsley and sippets
of bread.</p>

two-thirds as many as there is chopped meat. Mix all together
with one raw egg, one onion, black pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Fry with butter, either in large or small cakes in a pan, the

<p>After removing all tough, gristly pieces from the cold cooked
meat, chop it fine with some boiled potatoes. Put them in the
dressing, heat through, then serve. It injures meat to cook
it <i>again</i>, making it hard and unpalatable. Should you have
any cold gravy left, use it; in that case you will require less
butter, salt and pepper. You can serve it with buttered toast
underneath, or you may set it into the oven to brown on top,

drop out. Pick it very fine, taking all the bones out; then add
the liquor in which it was boiled, one tablespoonful butter, four
eggs well beaten; one small piece of lemon or pickle; one onion,

<p>All laid alternately in a baking-dish and filled nearly up
with any gravy or stock at hand; cover with a potato crust, full
two inches thick, and bake until the potatoes are a nice brown

<h2>EGGS.</h2>

<p>Properly cooked, eggs are very wholesome and nutritious diet.
Always be certain, however, that they are fresh, before attempting
to make a dish of them. Some persons use Krepp's family
egg-tester, to ascertain if an egg is sound. Full directions, as to
the mode of using it, accompany the egg tester; so it is unnecessary
to give them here. A simple mode of testing the soundness
of an egg, is to put it in water; and if fresh it will sink to
the bottom.

<h2>VEGETABLES.</h2>

<p>If possible, use vegetables gathered early in the morning, with
the dew on them. It is even better to gather them late the
evening before, with the evening dew on them (setting them in
the ice-house or some cool place), than to gather them after the
morning sun has grown hot. If you are living in the city, get
your vegetables from market as early in the morning as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as gathered or brought from market, all vegetables
should be carefully picked over, washed, placed in fresh water,
and set in a cool place till the cook is ready to put them on for
dinner.</p>

<p>Put them on in water neither cold nor boiling hot. The slow
heating that takes place when you put them on in cold water
deprives them of their flavor, to some extent, whilst too rapid
heating toughens the vegetable fibre.</p>

<p>Just before they are thoroughly done and tender, add sufficient
salt to season them. Do not stir them and mutilate them
with a spoon, but turn them into a colander and drain. Place
them in a hot dish and put a large tablespoonful of fresh butter
over them.</p>

<p>In cooking dried peas and beans, as well as corn, put up in
brine, always soak them the overnight. These vegetables
should first be parboiled, whether they are to be used for soup
or for side dishes.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Boil Green Peas.</span></p>

<p>Early in the morning, either buy the peas from market or
have them gathered in your garden, while the dew is on them.
Shell and lay in cold water till half an hour before dinner. Then

salt, just before taking from the fire. Drain, add a heaping

and tying up in bunches. Put on to boil one hour before dinner.
After boiling thirty minutes, drain, cut in pieces half an
inch long, and put in the saucepan with enough milk to cover
them. Just before serving, add one tablespoonful fresh butter,
in which one teaspoonful flour has been rubbed. Season with
salt and pepper.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p>In making catsup, or in scalding pickles in vinegar, if a brass
kettle is used, it must be scoured with sand and ashes, washed
and wiped dry, and then scoured with vinegar and salt. By
attending to these directions, the brass kettle may be safely used&mdash;though
the pickles or catsup must be poured from it the
instant it is taken from the fire, or they will canker.</p>

<p>In making pickles, it is a good rule to allow two pounds of
sugar to each gallon of vinegar for sour pickle, though a larger
proportion must be allowed for sweet pickle.</p>

<p>Vinegar for pickling should be spiced and set to sun from
spring to autumn. Never put pickle in a jar that has been
used for butter or lard. Examine often to see if the pickle is
well covered with vinegar, and if any of it has turned soft,
remove it. Keep it in a dry, airy closet, and be careful not to
let it freeze. Pickle is generally considered best when from six
months to a year old. Some housekeepers use the same vinegar
(with a slight addition) from year to year, by draining the
pickle as they take it out of the jar.

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Green Pickle.</span></p>

<p>Put the pickles in a strong brine, strong enough to bear an
egg. Three weeks is long enough for them to remain in brine,
if you wish to make your pickle early in the fall; but they will
keep several months, indeed all the winter, by having them
always well covered with the brine.</p>

<p>When ready to make your pickle, drain off <i>every drop</i> of
brine, and pour boiling water over the pickles. Repeat this for
three mornings in succession. Then pour off this last water,
and soak the pickles two days in cold water, changing the
water each morning. Next, pouring off this water, scald the
pickles <i>three</i> mornings in weak vinegar, weakening the vinegar
by putting two quarts of water to one of vinegar. This is the
time for greening the pickles, by putting in the jar or keg a
layer of pickle, then sprinkling in a little powdered alum, and
so on, till the vessel is filled; then pouring on the weakened
vinegar. Only use the alum the first morning; but the other
mornings pour off the vinegar and pour on a fresh quantity.
All this is necessary, if you wish to have pickle perfectly free
from the brine, and in a condition to keep. Fill your jars with
the pickle thus prepared, and pour over them the best of vinegar,
after seasoning it and letting it boil a few minutes. Seasoning
to one gallon vinegar:</p>

<div class="block-container">

<h2>CAKE.</h2>

<p>Before commencing to make cake, be sure that you have all
the ingredients in the house, and all the implements at hand,
such as trays, bowls, large dishes, large strong iron spoons, egg-beaters,
etc.</p>

<p>Use none but the best family flour in making cake. It is a
good plan to sift it before weighing or measuring it, and to let
it air and sun several hours before using it; as this makes it
much lighter.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to set aside rancid or indifferent butter
for cake-making. The butter used for the purpose should be
good and fresh.</p>

<p>Always use granulated sugar or else powdered loaf or cut
sugar; as pulverized sugar is apt to have plaster of Paris or
other foreign elements in it. Never use brown or even clarified
sugar in cake-making, unless it be for gingerbread.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to make cake without fresh eggs. Cream of
tartar, soda and yeast powders are poor substitutes for these.</p>

<p>A fresh egg placed in water will sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>In breaking eggs, do not break them over the vessels in which
they are to be beaten. Break them, one by one, over a saucer,
so that if you come across a defective one, you will not spoil
the rest by mixing it with them; whereas, if it is a good one,
it will be easy to pour the white from the saucer into the bowl
with the rest of the whites, and to add the yolk which you retain
in the egg-shell to the other yolks.</p>

<p>The Dover egg-beater saves much time and trouble in beating
eggs and will beat the yolks into as stiff a froth as the
whites. It is well to have two egg-beaters, one for the yolks
and the other for the whites. Eggs well beaten ought to be as
stiff as batter. Cool the dishes that you are to use in beating
eggs. In summer, keep the eggs on ice before using them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
always try to make the cake before breakfast, or as early in the
morning as possible.</p>

<p>Some of the best housewives think it advisable to cream the
butter and flour together, and add the sugar to the yolks when
these are whipped to a stiff froth, as it produces yellow specks
when you add the sugar sooner. The whites must always be
added last.</p>

<p>In making fruit cake, prepare the fruit the day before. In
winter time, this may be easily and pleasantly done after tea.
It requires a longer time to bake fruit cake, than plain. Every
housekeeper should have a close cake-box in which to put cake
after cooling it and wrapping it in a thick napkin.</p>

<h2>PUDDINGS.</h2>

<p>The directions given for cake apply likewise to puddings.
Always beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately and
very light, and add the whites just before baking or boiling.
All puddings (except those risen with yeast), should be baked
immediately after the ingredients are mixed. Thick yellow
earthenware dishes are better than tin for baking puddings,
on several accounts. One is that the pudding, to be good, must
be baked principally from the bottom, and tin burns more easily
than earthenware. Another reason is, that the acids employed
in some puddings corrode and discolor tin. Garnish the pudding
with sifted white sugar, and with candied or preserved
orange or lemon peel.</p>

<p>In boiling a pudding, cold water should never be added.
Keep a kettle of hot water to replenish the water in the pot as
it boils away. As soon as the pudding is done, remove it from
the boiling water. A decrease in heat whilst cooking, makes
boiled pudding sodden, and makes baked pudding fall. The
best sauce for a boiled pudding is cold sauce made of the frothed
whites of eggs, butter, sugar, nutmeg, and a little French
brandy, while for a baked pudding, a rich, boiled wine sauce is
best.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Plum Pudding.</span></p>

<p>3 pounds currants.</p>

<p>Mix and divide into six parts. Tie each part in a twilled

hours. Then hang them in the air to dry a day or two. Keep
them in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>When you wish to use one, it must be boiled an hour before

half an hour without intermission. In winter, set it in a warm

pound of butter, two pounds of stoned raisins, cut up, and a
grated nutmeg. Work very little, just enough to mix. Wet
a thick cloth, flour it and tie it loosely that the pudding may
have room to rise. Put it in a kettle of milk-warm water,
heating slowly until it boils. Boil one hour. Serve with wine
sauce.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Rich Plum Pudding.</span></p>

<p>Nine eggs beaten to a froth.</p>

<p>Add flour sufficient to make a thick batter, free from lumps.
Then add one pint of new milk and beat well. Afterwards add
the following ingredients, in small quantities at a time, keeping
it well stirred.</p>

<p>Two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, well washed,
picked, and dried. One-quarter pound bitter almonds, blanched
and divided; three-quarters pound brown sugar; three-quarters
pound beef suet, chopped fine; one nutmeg, grated fine; one
teaspoonful of ground allspice, the same of mace and cinnamon.</p>

<p>This pudding should be mixed several days before cooking,
then well beaten, and more milk should be added, if required.
Make this into two puddings, put in cotton bags and boil four
hours. By changing the bags, and hanging in a cool, dry place,
they will keep six months and be the better for it. Steam and
serve with sauce made as follows:</p>

<p>One cup of sugar, one of butter. Beat well together.
Break an egg in and mix well. Add a tablespoonful of wine
or brandy, and serve immediately.&mdash;<i>Mrs. F.</i></p>

<p>Slice some stale bread, omitting the crust. Butter it moderately
thick. Butter a deep dish, and cover the bottom with
slices of bread, over which put a layer of any kind of preserved
fruit. (Acid fruits are best.) Cover all with a light layer of
brown sugar. Make a rich custard, allowing four eggs to a

<h2>PASTRY.</h2>

<p>Pastry has fallen somewhat into disfavor, on account of its
unwholesome properties, but as many persons still use it, we
will give some directions for making it as wholesome and palatable
as possible.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to use what is called "cooking butter"
and old lard for pastry. Only fresh butter and sweet lard should
be employed for the purpose, and in summer these should be
placed on ice before being used for pastry. Pastry, like cake,
should be made in the cool of the morning, and it should be
eaten fresh, as, unlike cake, it will not admit of being kept.</p>

<p>If a marble slab cannot be obtained, it is well to keep a thick
wooden board exclusively for rolling out pastry. Handle as
little as possible, and if anything should prevent you from putting
it on to bake as soon as it is rolled out, put it on ice in the
interim, as this will make it nicer and more flaky. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
there is a delay about getting the oven or fire ready, in which
case the cook generally leaves the pastry lying on the kitchen
table; but its quality would be much improved if it were put on
the ice instead, whilst waiting to be baked.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Excellent Recipe for Pastry.</span></p>

<p>Four teacups flour, one teacup firm butter, one teacup nice
lard, one teacup ice water, one teaspoonful salt. Mix the lard
and butter in the flour with a large, flat knife, then add the ice
water. Do not touch it with the hands. Take it up in a rough-looking
mass, roll it out quickly&mdash;not too thin. Cut it with a
very sharp knife around the edges of the patty-pans. When
intending to bake lemon puddings or cheese-cakes, let the pastry
bake four or five minutes before adding butter, as this prevents
the pastry from being heavy at the bottom. In summer it is best
to put five teacups of flour, instead of four.&mdash;<i>Mrs. M. C. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Pastry.</span></p>

<p>One pound fresh butter, one quart flour. Make up the dough
with ice water. Divide the butter into parts. Roll out, and
cover thickly with one part of the butter. Continue till all is
rolled, sifting flour each time. Don't handle much, or it will be
heavy.&mdash;<i>Mrs. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Pastry.</i></p>

<p>Mix with water one quart flour and two teaspoonfuls salt.
Work well and roll out thin. Spread over with lard, sift flour
over the dough, and cut it in strips of two inches. Lay them
in a pile one above another, cut them in squares, and again pile
them up. Press down with the hands, and roll out thin as
before. Repeat this several times, and the pastry will be improved
each time. Do not use your hands after the roller is
applied.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Puff Paste.</span></p>

<p>One pound flour, to be made up with cold water and beaten
fifteen minutes. One pound butter (or half lard, if you have

not enough butter), which must be spread on the dough four
times and rolled in.</p>

<p>It must be made thin, put in tins, and baked in a moderate
oven.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lemon Pie.</span></p>

then the lemon-juice and grated rind, stirring the whole well
together. Line the plates with rich pastry, and pour the mixture
in. Bake until the crust is done. Beat the whites of the
eggs very light, add six ounces powdered sugar, pour over the
pies, set them again in the oven, and slightly brown. This will
make two pies.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T. M. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Lemon Pie.</i></p>

<h2>JELLY, BLANC-MANGE, CHARLOTTE RUSSE,
BAKED CUSTARD, CREAMS, ETC.</h2>

<p>Jelly made of the feet of calves, hogs, etc., is more troublesome,
but is also considered more nutritious than jelly made of
gelatine. It is very desirable, for country housekeepers in particular,
to make this sort of jelly, as the materials are generally
in their reach. It is well, however, in all cases, to keep on
hand Cox's or Nelson's gelatine, on account of the expedition
with which jelly may be made from these preparations.</p>

<p>As jelly is considered more wholesome when not colored by
any foreign substance, no directions will be given in the subsequent
pages for coloring it. The palest amber jelly, clear and
sparkling, flavored only by the grated rind and juice of a lemon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
and pale Madeira or sherry wine, is not only the most beautiful,
but the most palatable jelly that can be made.</p>

<p>Though the recipes accompanying boxes of gelatine do not
always recommend boiling, it is a great improvement to jelly,
adding brilliancy, transparency, and a better flavor. Only the
grated yellow rind and strained juice of the lemon should be
used, and these, with the requisite quantity of pale Madeira or
sherry, should be added after the other ingredients have been
well boiled together. The white rind or one single lemon seed
will render the jelly bitter. A delicious preserve (for which
a receipt is given under the proper heading), may be made of
lemons, after the yellow rind has been grated off and the juice
pressed out for jelly.</p>

<p>The best and most simple arrangement for straining jelly is to
invert a small table, fold an old table-cloth four double, tie each
corner to a leg of the table; set a bowl under the bag thus
formed, with another bowl at hand to slip in its place when the
jelly first run through is returned to the bag, as will be necessary,
the first never being transparently clear. Catch a little in
a glass. If clear as crystal, it will be unnecessary to return it
again to the bag. You may then put a thick cloth over the bag
to keep in the heat, and if in winter, place before a fire. Shut
up the room, and let it drip. The jelly will run through the
bag more rapidly if the bag is first scalded.</p>

<p>Jelly should never be made in hot weather. Ices are much
better and more seasonable.</p>

<p>Always serve jelly with a pitcher of whipped cream, but do
not mix it beforehand with the cream, as it is best to leave it to
the taste of each person.</p>

<p>For blanc-mange and gelatine, it is best to use gelatine and
as few spices as possible, as spices turn gelatine dark. As such
explicit directions are given in the subsequent pages for the
making of these dishes, it is unnecessary to say anything further
on the subject at present.</p>

<p>A nice custard is made in the following manner: Mix the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
beaten yolks of six eggs with a teacup of sugar. Have a quart
of milk boiling in a kettle. Dip up a teacup of milk at a time
and pour on the eggs, till the kettle is emptied, stirring rapidly
all the time. Wash out the kettle, pour the mixture back, and
stir constantly till it thickens. Then pour it into a bowl and
stir till cool, to make it smooth and prevent it from curdling.
Put in the bottom of glass mugs slips of preserved orange,
lemon, or citron. Fill nearly full with custard; put whipped
cream and grated nutmeg on top.</p>

<p>Or, the yolks may be mixed with boiled milk and sugar in the
same proportions, but instead of being returned to the kettle,
may be poured into china or earthenware custard-cups, set in a
pan of boiling water, placed in a stove or range, and baked.
The boiled milk must be seasoned by boiling a vanilla bean in
it, or a few peach leaves, or it may be flavored with caromel.
Serve the custard with whipped cream on top.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Stock Jelly.</span></p>

<p>To one and a half gallons of stock, put the whipped whites of
eight eggs. Put in six blades of mace and the rind of three
lemons, 4½ pounds sugar. Let it boil ten minutes, then add three
pints of Madeira wine, juice of eight lemons, a little vinegar or
sharp cider. Let it boil only a few minutes. Strain through a
dripper. If the stock is not very nice, it may require the
whites of one dozen eggs to clear it.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Calves' Foot Jelly.</span></p>

<p>One quart nice jelly stock, one pint wine, half a pound white

pour out the whole. Peel the lemons as thin as possible and
strain the jelly on the peelings. Should you wish to turn out
the jelly in moulds, put one ounce isinglass to three pints of
jelly.&mdash;<i>Mrs. I. H.</i>

<h2>ICE CREAM AND FROZEN CUSTARD.</h2>

<p>After having tried many new and patent freezers, some of the
best housekeepers have come to the conclusion that the old-fashioned
freezer is the best. It is well, however, to keep a
patent freezer on hand, in case of your wanting ice cream on
short notice; but for common use an old-fashioned one is the
best, especially as servants are so apt to get a patent freezer out
of order.</p>

<p>The great secret of freezing cream quickly in a common
freezer is to have the cream and salt in readiness before breaking
the ice into small pieces the size of a walnut. There must
be a space of two inches between the freezer and the tub in
which it is set. Put a little ice and salt under the bottom of
the freezer, then pack alternate layers of ice and salt several
inches higher than the cream is in the freezer. If there is no
top to the tub, with an aperture to admit the freezer, pin a
woollen cloth over it and turn the freezer rapidly. When the
cream begins to harden on the sides of the freezer, cut it down

with a knife, scrape from the sides, and beat with a large iron
spoon. Then cover again, and turn rapidly till it is as hard
as mush. When the ice begins to melt, drain off the salt and
water, adding more salt and ice, which must be kept above the
level of the cream in the freezer. When done, tie large newspapers
over the tub and freezer. Put a woollen cloth or blanket
over these, and set the cream in a dark, cool closet till wanted.
In this way it may be kept for hours in summer, and for days
in winter, and will grow harder instead of melting. As cream
can be kept thus, it is well to make it early in the day and set
it aside, leaving more leisure for other preparations that are
better made immediately before dinner.</p>

<p>Ice cream making, like other branches of housekeeping, is
much facilitated by having all the ingredients at hand before
beginning on it. As such explicit directions for the process
are given in the subsequent pages, it is unnecessary for me to
add anything further on the subject. Unless you have pure
cream to freeze, it is better to make plain boiled custard rather
than to attempt an imitation of ice cream.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to make jelly and custard at the same time,
so that the yolks of eggs not used in the jelly may be utilized in
custard either boiled or baked. The same proportions are generally
used for boiled and baked custard. Instead of flavoring
with extract of vanilla, it is much better to boil a vanilla bean
in the milk, or to boil some peach leaves tied up in a piece of
muslin (six or eight leaves to a quart of milk), or to flavor it
with burnt sugar. Never flavor custard with extract of lemon,
when you can obtain fresh lemons for the purpose.</p>

<p>When you have no yolks left from making jelly, boil a quart
of milk (flavored by the above directions). Have ready three
eggs, whites and yolks beaten together to a stiff froth, and into
these stir a teacup of powdered white sugar. Dip up the boiling
milk, pour slowly on the eggs, stirring rapidly. When all
the milk has been stirred in the eggs, wash out the kettle, put
the milk and eggs back into it, and let the mixture boil till it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
begins to thicken, when it must be taken immediately from the
fire, poured into a bowl, and stirred till cold and smooth.</p>

<p>Many persons, before freezing, stir in the frothed whites of
three eggs. The same directions given for freezing cream apply
to the freezing of custard.</p>

<p>Boiled custard should never be used as a substitute for cream
in making fruit ice creams, nor should it ever be eaten with
jelly.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Ice Cream.</span></p>

<p>Dissolve five teaspoonfuls Oswego starch or arrow-root in a
teacup milk. Add to it the whites of three eggs well frothed,
and the yolk of one, well beaten.</p>

<p>Sweeten with loaf sugar and boil half a gallon new milk. As
soon as it begins to boil, pour it in small quantities over the
mixture of eggs and starch, till about half the milk is taken out
of the kettle. Then pour all back in the kettle and stir a few
moments. After it cools, add one quart rich cream; season to
the taste and freeze.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Dr. E.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Ice Cream.</i></p>

<p>One quart milk, two eggs, one teaspoonful corn starch, one

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lemon Ice Cream.</span></p>

<p>One gallon rich cream, six lemons, first rubbed till soft, and
then grated. Tie the yellow peel, which has been grated off, in
a piece of coarse muslin. Cut each lemon in half and squeeze
the juice from it. Strain the juice, and soak the muslin bag of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
lemon peel in it, squeezing it frequently till it becomes highly
flavored and colored by it. Then add two teacups of sugar.</p>

<p>In sweetening the cream, allow a teacup of sugar to each
quart. Pour the juice into it slowly, carefully stirring. Froth
and freeze, reserving a portion of cream to pour in as it sinks
in freezing.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Orange Ice Cream.</span></p>

<p>Four oranges, one gallon cream. Rub four or five lumps of

pulverized sugar before freezing.&mdash;<i>Mrs. M.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Strawberry Cream.</span></p>

<p>Four quarts thick sweet cream, four quarts strawberries.
The berries must be mashed or bruised, caps and all, with a
teacup of granulated sugar to each quart. After standing
several hours, strain through a thin coarse cloth.</p>

<p>Put four teacups of white sugar to the cream, and then add
the juice of the berries. Whip or froth the cream with
a patent egg-whip or common egg-beater. Pour two-thirds of
the cream into the freezer, reserving the rest to pour in after it
begins to freeze. Raspberry cream may be made by the same
recipe.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Peach Cream.</span></p>

<p>Take nice, soft peaches, perfectly ripe. Pare and chop fine,
make them very sweet, and mash to a fine jam. To each quart
of peaches, add one pint of cream and one pint of rich milk.
Mix well and freeze. If you cannot get cream, melt an ounce
of Cox's gelatine in a cup of water. Boil the milk, pour it on
the gelatine, and when cold, mix with the peaches.&mdash;<i>L. D. L.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Peach Cream.</i></p>

<p>To two quarts of rich, sweet cream, add two teacups of sugar.
Whip to a stiff froth with a patent egg-whip, one with a wheel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
if convenient; if not, use the common egg-whip. Then peel
soft, ripe peaches till you have about two quarts. As you peel,
sprinkle over them two teacups powdered white sugar. Mash
quickly with a silver tablespoon, or run through a colander, if
the fruit is not soft and ripe. Then stir into the whipped
cream, and pour into the freezer, reserving about one-fourth to
add when the cream begins to sink in freezing. When you add
the remainder, first cut down the frozen cream from the sides
of the freezer. Beat hard with a strong iron spoon, whenever
the freezer is opened to cut down the cream, till it becomes too
hard. This beating and cutting down is required only for the
common freezer, the patent freezer needing nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Tie over the freezer large newspapers, to exclude the air, and
set aside till wanted.</p>

<p>Apricot cream may be made exactly by this receipt.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p>Grate two ripe pineapples, and add to them two teacups
white sugar. When well mixed, stir into the cream.</p>

<p>Pour into the freezer, reserving one-fourth. When it begins
to freeze, it will sink; then beat in the remainder with a strong
iron spoon. Beat every time the freezer is opened to cut down
the cream from the sides. Never cook fruit of any sort to make
cream.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<h2>PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES.</h2>

<p>Always make preserves in a porcelain or brass kettle. If the
latter, have it scoured first with sand, then with salt and vinegar.
Then scald it and put in the sugar and water for the
syrup.</p>

<p>In peeling fruit, throw it into cold water to keep it from
turning dark, and let it remain there till you are ready to
throw it in the boiling syrup. Bear in mind that exposure to
the air turns peeled fruit dark.</p>

<p>Boil rather quickly. In preserving fruit whole, boil it a
short time in the syrup, take it out, let it get cold, and then
put it again in the kettle.</p>

<p>Cut sugar is best for preserves which you wish to be clear
and light-colored, but nice brown sugar is best for dark-colored
jams and marmalades, such as those made of blackberries, raspberries,
whortleberries, etc.</p>

<p>The best peaches for preserving, brandying, or pickling, are
white freestone peaches, not quite ripe enough to eat with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
cream. Pears and quinces also should be preserved before they
are quite ripe enough for eating. They should be parboiled
before eating. No fruit should be over-ripe when preserved.
Damsons and blue plums should be slit lengthwise with a pen
knife, and set in the sun before preserving, which will render
it easy to extract the stones. Cherries also should be stoned
before preserving. A piece of paper dipped in brandy and laid
on top the preserves will help to keep them. I would suggest
to housekeepers that they always put their preserves in glass
jars with screw tops. By this means they can readily inspect
it and see if it is keeping well, without the trouble of untying
the jar and looking inside, as would be necessary in the case of
stone jars.</p>

<p>Set the jar of preserves, if they become dry or candied, in a
pot of cold water, which allow to come gradually to a boil. If
the preserves ferment, boil them over with more sugar.</p>

<p>The great secret of making nice fruit jelly is to boil the syrup
well before adding the sugar (which should always be loaf or
cut), and you should allow a pound of sugar to a pint of the
juice in acid fruit jellies, though less will answer for sweet
fruit. By boiling the syrup well before adding the sugar, the
flavor and color of the fruit are retained. Keep the jelly in
small, common glasses.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Sweetmeat Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Cut the rind in any shapes fancied (such as flowers, fruits,
leaves, grapes, fish, etc.), put it in brine strong enough to float
an egg, cover closely with grape leaves, and set away the jar.
When ready to make the preserves, soak the rind in fresh
water, changing it till all taste of salt is removed from the rind.
Dissolve four tablespoonfuls pulverized alum in one gallon
water. Lay the rind in this, covered closely with grape or
cabbage leaves. Simmer till it becomes a pretty green, then
soak out the alum by throwing the rind in soft water.</p>

<p>Pour boiling water on half a pound white ginger, and let it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
stand long enough to soften sufficiently to slice easily in thin
pieces (retaining the shapes of the races as much as possible).
Then boil it an hour in half a gallon water, and add one ounce
mace and two pounds best cut sugar. This makes a thin syrup,
in which boil the rind gently for half an hour, adding water to
keep the rind covered with syrup.</p>

<p>Set the kettle away for four days and then boil again as before,
adding two pounds sugar and more water, if necessary.
Repeat the boiling six or seven times, till the syrup is rich and
thick and sufficient to cover the rind.</p>

<p>The quantity of seasoning given above is for three gallons
rind. Allow two pounds sugar to each pound fruit. This
sweetmeat keeps indefinitely and never ferments.&mdash;<i>Mrs. F. M. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Watermelon or Muskmelon Marmalade.</span></p>

<p>Weigh twelve pounds rind, previously soaked in brine, and
the salt extracted by fresh water, parboil, put on with twelve
pounds sugar made into a thin syrup, and boil to pieces. Add
the peelings of twelve oranges and twelve lemons, previously
soaked in water, cut in strips and boiled extremely soft, the
water being changed three times while boiling. Stir constantly
from the bottom with a batter-cake turner. Cook very
thick. Put in wide-mouthed glass jars.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Ripe Muskmelon or Watermelon Preserves.</span></p>

<p>During the summer, peel and slice indifferent cantaleupes
(such as you do not care to eat), especially such as are not quite
ripe. Throw them into brine, together with your thickest watermelon
rinds, peeling off the outside skin. When you have
enough, weigh them, throw them in fresh water, which change
daily till the salt is extracted. Boil in a preserving kettle till
soft enough to pierce with a straw. Make a syrup, allowing
one pound sugar for each pound fruit. When it boils, put the
rind in it and simmer steadily till the rind is transparent and
the syrup thick. When cool, add the juice and grated rind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
twelve lemons. Let it stand in a bowl several days. Then
strain the syrup (which will have become thin), boil it again,
pour over the rind, and put the preserves in glass jars with
screw tops.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Ripe Muskmelon Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Peel and slice the melons, soak them twenty-four hours in
salt water, twenty-four hours in alum water, and twenty-four
hours in fresh water, changing the latter several times. Then
make a strong ginger tea, in which boil them slowly till they
taste of ginger.</p>

<p>Make a syrup, allowing a pound and a half sugar to each
pound fruit, and adding mace and sliced ginger (the latter
must be soaked in boiling water twelve hours before it is wanted).
Cook the melon in the syrup till clear and tender. You may
use sliced lemons as a seasoning instead of ginger.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R. L.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Pineapple Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Parboil the pineapples, then peel and cut in thick slices,
carefully taking out the cores, which, if allowed to remain, will
cause the preserves to ferment. Put a pound of sugar to a
pound of fruit, and let it remain all night to make the syrup.
Boil then till done, without adding a drop of water to the syrup.
&mdash;<i>Mrs. F. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Orange Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Peel a thin rind off the oranges and make a hole in each end,
getting out all the seed. Pour boiling water over them and let
them stand till next morning. If the water tastes bitter, search
for seed. Pour boiling water over them every day, as long as
the bitterness remains. Boil till soft enough to run a straw
through them. Add a pound and a half sugar to each pound
fruit. Make a thin syrup of half the sugar, and boil the oranges
in it a short time. Let them stand in the syrup three days,
then pour the syrup from the fruit, put the rest of the sugar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
it, and boil it down thick. Then pour it over the fruit. A
few lemons added is a great improvement.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J. H.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Orange Marmalade.</span></p>

<p>Peel the oranges, taking all the seed and tough skin out of
them. Cut the peel in small pieces, put in cold water and boil
till tender. Make a syrup, one pound sugar to one pint water.
Put a pound of the oranges (mixed with the peel) to a pint of
the syrup, and boil all for two hours.&mdash;<i>Mrs. C. C. McP.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Orange Marmalade.</span></p>

<p>The day before making, peel one dozen oranges (no matter
how sour and indifferent). Throw the peel in a bucket of
water, take out the seed, cut up the pulp fine with a pair of
old scissors. Then take the peel, cut it in thin strips and throw
it into fresh water. Pare and slice pippins (or any other nice
apple). Weigh six pounds of them, stew with a little water till
perfectly done, and set away. Next day, run this pulp through
a colander into a preserving kettle. Add six pounds sugar and
boil slowly, constantly scraping from the bottom.</p>

<p>Take the orange peel (which should have been left in soak all
night), boil till perfectly soft and free from bitterness, changing
the water three times while boiling. In another preserving
kettle, simmer this with the orange pulp and two pounds sugar.
When both are nearly done, turn the oranges into the apples
and cook them very thick. Cool in a bowl, and then put in a
glass jar with a screw top.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Sliced Lemon Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Take large, firm lemons, not quite ripe, cut in slices one-quarter
inch thick, and take out the seed. Soak in brine a week.
Then soak several days in clear water, changing the water twice
a day. When all the salt and the bitter taste are extracted,
weigh the lemons and boil till tender enough to pierce with a
straw. Make a thin syrup, allowing one pound of sugar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
each pound of fruit. Put the lemons in and let them simmer
slowly a good many hours. Pour into a large bowl and let it
remain there several days. At the end of that time strain the
syrup (which will have become thin), put the lemons in it
again, and boil till they jelly. When cool put in a glass jar
with a screw top. The same recipe may be used for oranges.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lemon Marmalade.</span></p>

<p>Every housekeeper should keep a large jar, or other nice
vessel, filled with brine, in which she may throw lemon peels
after being deprived of the grated rind and juice, used for
creams, jellies, etc. These may remain any length of time, to
suit one's convenience. Before preserving, soak in pure water
till all the taste of salt is extracted. Boil till soft enough to
pierce with a straw. Then put in a preserving kettle nine
pounds cut sugar and one quart water. As soon as it boils, add
six pounds lemon peel and three pounds nice sliced apples
(pippins are best). Boil till very thick.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lemon Preserves</span></p>

<p>May be made of lemon peel, prepared exactly by the above
recipe. Put the peel in a preserving kettle and keep covered,
while boiling in clear water, till you can run a straw through
it. Then throw it into a rich syrup (one pound sugar to one
of lemon peel), and boil a long time. Put in a bowl till the
next day; then take the syrup (which will be somewhat thin)
and boil again till very thick. Pour it over the lemon, and when
cold it will be jellied.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Peach Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Pare white freestone peaches, not quite ripe. Split in half,
take out the stones, and throw the peaches in a bucket of water
to prevent them from turning dark. Make a syrup of white
sugar, using as many pounds of sugar as you have pounds of
peaches. When it has boiled thick, put in as many peaches as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
will cover the bottom of the kettle. Let them boil till nearly
done; then take them out, one by one, in a perforated spoon.
Lay them in dishes and set in the sun. When all the peaches
have been carried through this process, put back the first dish
of peaches in the kettle, taking them out when a pretty amber
color, and so on till all have been boiled twice. Meantime the
peach-kernels should have been scalded and skinned. Put them
in the boiling syrup, which must be kept on the fire till very
thick. Put the peaches when cool in glass jars, and pour the
syrup over them. In a few days examine, and if the syrup has
become thin, boil again.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Peach Preserves.</i></p>

<p>Pare, and add to a pound of peaches one and one-quarter
pounds best sugar. Cook very fast for a few moments, in a
porcelain kettle. Turn out in a bowl, cover with muslin or
cambric, set in the sun, stirring every day till they seem quite
transparent. They retain their flavor much better this way than
when cooked on the fire. Put in jars, cover with paper saturated
with brandy, and tie up tightly to exclude the air.&mdash;<i>Mrs. P. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Peach Marmalade.</span></p>

<p>Boil twelve pounds soft peaches in a little water. When reduced
to a pulp, run through a colander and boil again till very
thick, constantly scraping from the bottom. Add half a pound
sugar to one pound fruit. Cool in a bowl, and then put in glass
jars with screw tops. Pear marmalade may be made by the
same recipe, and also apple marmalade, except that you flavor
the last with lemon juice and rind.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Brandy Peaches.</span></p>

<p>For twelve pounds large freestone Heath peaches, not quite
ripe and delicately pared, make a syrup of four pounds sugar.
Scald a few peaches at a time in the syrup, till all have gone
through this process. Place on dishes to cool. Then put in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
glass jars and add enough good whiskey or brandy to the syrup
to cover the peaches. Any spirit will do, if strong enough.
Add a few blanched peach-kernels. In a few days see if more
liquor or sugar is required. If so, drain off the syrup, add what
is needed, and pour again over the fruit. It is a mistake to put
too much sugar. Always use freestone peaches.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Brandy Peaches.</i></p>

<p>Put the peaches (a few at a time) in boiling lye. Let them
remain five minutes, to loosen the fur. Then take them out and
wipe perfectly clean and white. Then drop them in cold water.
Boil them gently in a rich syrup till a straw will pierce them.
Then put in a jar, and mix equal parts of French brandy with
the syrup. Carefully exclude the air.&mdash;<i>Mrs. G. N.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Pear Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Scald the fruit, but do not let it remain till it comes to
pieces. Boil till clear, in a syrup made of as many pounds of
sugar as you have of fruit.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J. J. A.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Preserved Apples for Winter Use.</span></p>

<p>Pare and slice pippins. Put to each pound apples half a
pound sugar, and to every eight pounds thus sweetened one
quart water, a few cloves, the thin rind and juice of a lemon.
Stew till clear, and eat with cream.&mdash;<i>Mrs. B. J. B.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Apple Mange.</span></p>

<p>Stew and mash well three pounds pippins, then add three
pounds sugar. Just before they are done, add a few drops
lemon juice. Put in moulds and it will keep two years.
Turned out and sliced, it is a nice dish for tea. Quinces are as
nice as apples, prepared this way.&mdash;<i>Mrs. B. J. B.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Crab Apple Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Put the crab apples in a kettle, with some alum, keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
them scalding hot for an hour. Take them out, skin and extract
the seed with a small knife, leaving on the stems. Put
them in cold water awhile, then take them out, wipe them and
put them in a syrup made of as many pounds sugar as you have
of fruit. Let them stew gently till they look clear, then take
them out and let the syrup boil longer. Siberian crabs may be
preserved in the same way, except that they are not peeled and
cored.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Quince Jam.</span></p>

<p>Pour boiling water over them and let them remain till the
skin rubs off easily. Then peel them and cut off the fair slices.
To each pound put twelve ounces sugar, and let them stew
together till the syrup is sufficiently thick.</p>

<p>Quince preserves may be made by the same recipe as that
used for pears.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Damson Preserves.</span></p>

<p>With a sharp penknife, cut a long slit lengthwise in each damson.
Spread in dishes and set in the sun till the seed comes
out readily. Then boil till thoroughly done in a thick syrup
made of as many pounds sugar as there are pounds of damsons.</p>

<p>Preserve green gage plums and other plums by the same
recipe.&mdash;<i>Miss P.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Fox Grape Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Seed the grapes, then pour scalding water on them and let
them stand till cold; then draw off the water, put one pound
sugar to one pound of grapes, and boil gently about twenty minutes.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Cherry Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Wash, pick and stone the cherries, saving the juice. Allow
one pound sugar to each pound fruit. Boil the juice and sugar
to a thick syrup, then put in half the cherries and stew till
nearly done. Take them out with a perforated spoon and lay
on dishes. Pat in the other half, let them stew as long as the
first; then take out and lay in dishes. Meantime boil the syrup
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
gently. When the cherries are cool, put them again in the syrup
and boil a short time. Pour in a large bowl and cool, then put
in glass jars and cover tightly.</p>

<p>Scarlet short stems and large wax cherries are best for preserving.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Strawberry Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Cap the berries. Put one and a half pounds sugar to each
pound fruit. Let them stand two or three hours, and then boil
thirty minutes.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Strawberry Jam.</span></p>

<p>Cap and wash the berries, and put them on to stew with a very
small quantity of water. Stir constantly. When thoroughly
done and mashed to a soft pulp, add one pound sugar to each
pound fruit. The advantage of adding sugar last is that it preserves
the color and flavor of the fruit. Stew till sufficiently
thick, scraping constantly from the bottom with a batter-cake
turner.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Raspberry Jam.</span></p>

<p>Wash and pick the berries, boil with a little water, mashing
and scraping from the bottom as they simmer. When reduced
to a thick pulp, add one-half pound sugar to each pound berries.
Stew till very thick, scraping constantly from the bottom. Cool
in a large bowl, then put in a glass jar with screw top. Blackberry,
Dewberry, and Whortleberry Jam may be made by the
same recipe.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Fig Preserves.</span></p>

<p>Pick the figs fully ripe the evening before. Cut off about
half the stem, and let them soak all night in very weak salt and
water. Drain off the salt water in the morning and cover them
with fresh. Make a thick syrup, allowing three-quarters pound
loaf sugar to each pound fruit. When it boils, drop the figs
carefully in and let them cook till they look clear. When done
take from the fire and season with extract of lemon or ginger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span></p>

<p>The figs must not be peeled, as the salt water removes the
roughness from the skin and keeps the fruit firm and hard.&mdash;<i>Miss
A. S.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Tomato Preserves</span> (<i>either ripe or green</i>).</p>

<p>The day before preserving, peel and weigh eight pounds pale
yellow, pear-shaped or round tomatoes, not quite ripe; spread
on dishes alternate layers of tomato and sugar, mixing with the
latter the grated rind and juice of four lemons. In the morning,
drain off the juice and sugar and boil to a thick syrup.
Drop in half the tomatoes and boil till transparent. Take up
with a perforated spoon and put on dishes to cool. Then carry
the other half through exactly the same process. Then strain
the juice, wash the kettle, and put in the juice again. When it
boils hard, put in again the first boiled tomatoes. Take them
out when they become amber color, and put in the rest. When
they are all boiled to an amber color, and cooled on dishes, put
them in half-gallon glass jars, and add the syrup after it has
been boiled to a thick jelly.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Green Tomato Sweetmeats.</span></p>

<p>Slice the tomatoes and soak them a day and night in salt and
water, then in fresh water for an hour or two, then scald in
alum water with grape leaves. When taken out of alum water,
put in cold water to cook. Scald in ginger-tea and again put
in cold water, while you make the syrup. To each pound tomatoes
put one and a quarter pounds sugar and a few races of
white ginger. Cook the tomatoes till clear, the syrup till thick.
When cool, season the syrup with essence of lemon and pour
over the tomatoes.&mdash;<i>Mrs. C. M.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Recipe for putting up Fruit.</span></p>

<p>For fruit not very acid, weigh one-quarter of a pound white

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Cranberry Jelly.</span></p>

<p>Wash and pick the cranberries, put them in the preserving
kettle with a very small quantity of water, cover closely and

squeezing, as this will prevent it from being clear. Measure
and pour the liquid into the preserving kettle. Let it boil up
and remove the scum, then add the sugar, cut or loaf, one pound
to a pint. Boil about twenty minutes, or until it jellies. It
preserves the color of fruit jellies to add the sugar as late as

<p>Gather Catawba grapes before ripening. Pick them from
the stem, wash them, and put them in a stone jar. Set the
jar in a kettle of cold water over a hot fire. When the juice
comes out of the grapes, take the kettle off and strain the
grapes. To each pint of juice put one pound of the best loaf
sugar. Boil twenty minutes in the kettle. Ripe grape jelly
may be made in the same way.&mdash;<i>Mrs. E.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Grape Jelly.</span></p>

<p>The chief art in making jelly is to boil it continuously, slowly
and gently. It will not harden well if the boiling stops, even
for a few moments. To preserve the true color and flavor of
fruit in jellies or jams, boil well before adding the sugar; in
this way the water contained in all fruit juices is evaporated.
Heat the sugar before adding it. In making grape jelly, pick
the grapes from their stems, wash them, put them over the fire
in a vessel containing a little water, to keep them from burning.
Stew a few moments; mash gently with a silver spoon,
strain, and to every pint of juice, allow one pound of white
sugar. After the juice comes to the boiling point, boil twenty

<h2>WINE.</h2>

<p>Be sure to get perfectly ripe fruit for making wine, but do
not gather it immediately after rain, as it is watery then and
less sweet than usual.</p>

<p>Be very careful to stop the wine securely as soon as fermentation
ceases, as otherwise it will lose its strength and flavor.
Watch carefully to see when fermentation ceases.</p>

<p>Strawberry wine makes a delicious flavoring for syllabub,
cake, jelly, etc., and so does gooseberry wine. Dewberries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
make a prettier and better wine than blackberries, and have all
the medicinal virtues of the latter.</p>

<p>The clearest wine is made without straining, by the following
process: Take a tub or barrel (a flour-barrel for instance), and
make a little pen of sticks of wood at the bottom. On top of
this pen lay an armful of clean straw. Bore a hole in the
side of the tub or barrel as near the bottom as possible, and set
it on a stool or box so as to admit of setting a vessel underneath
it. After mashing the berries intended for wine, put them on top
the straw, and let the juice drain through it and run through the
hole at the side of the tub or barrel into the vessel set beneath
to catch it. Be careful to have this vessel large enough to
avoid its being overrun. Any open stone vessel not used before
for pickle will answer, or a bucket or other wooden vessel
may be used. Let the berries remain on the straw and drain
from evening till the next morning. Some persons make a
slight variation on the process above described, by pouring hot
water over the berries after putting them on the straw. After
the draining is over, an inferior sort of wine may be made by
squeezing the berries.</p>

<p>The following process will make wine perfectly clear: To a
half-gallon of wine put two wine-glasses of sweet milk. Stir
it into the wine and pour it all in a transparent half-gallon bottle.
Stop it and set it by for twenty-four hours, at the end of which
time the wine will be beautifully clear, the sediment settling
with the milk at the bottom. Pour off the wine carefully into
another bottle, not allowing any of the sediment or milk to get
into the fresh bottle. The same directions apply to vinegar.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Blackberry Wine.</span></p>

<p>Fill large stone jars with ripe black or dewberries. Cover
them with water, mash them, and let them stand several hours,
or, if freshly gathered, let them stand all night. Then strain
through a thick cloth and add three pounds white sugar to each
gallon of juice. Let the wine stand a few days in the jars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
stirring and skimming each day. Put it in a demijohn, but
do not cork it up for some time.&mdash;<i>Mrs. M. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Blackberry Wine.</i></p>

<p>Measure the berries and bruise them; to every gallon adding
one quart of boiling water. Let it stand twenty-four hours,
stirring occasionally; then strain off the liquor into a cask, adding
two pounds sugar to every gallon. Cork tight and let it
stand till the following October, when it will be ready for use
without further boiling or straining.</p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Blackberry Wine.</i></p>

<p>One bushel very ripe berries makes ten gallons wine. Mash
the berries as fine as possible and pour over them a water-bucket
of clear spring water. Cover it and let it stand twenty-four
hours to ferment. Next day strain through a cloth, and to every
three quarts juice add two quarts clear cold water and five
pounds common brown sugar. Pour in a demijohn or runlet,
reserving some to fill the vessel as fermentation goes on. After
six or eight days, put to every ten gallons one-half box gelatine.
After two weeks, cover the bung-hole with a piece of muslin.
Two or three weeks later, cork tightly and then leave undisturbed
for six months. After that time, bottle and seal. Superior
currant wine may be made by this recipe.&mdash;<i>Mrs. F.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Blackberry Wine.</i></p>

<p>Fill a large stone jar with the ripe fruit and cover it with
water. Tie a cloth over the jar and let them stand three or
four days to ferment; then mash and press them through a
cloth. To every gallon of juice add three pounds of brown
sugar. Return the mixture to the jar and cover closely. Skim
it every morning for more than a week, until it clears from the
second fermentation. When clear, pour it carefully from the
sediment into a demijohn. Cork tightly, set in a cool place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Grape Wine.</span></p>

<p>Take any convenient quantity of perfectly ripe grapes. Mash
them so as to break all the skins, and put them in a tub or
other clean vessel, and let them remain twenty-four hours; with
a cider-press or other convenient apparatus, express all the juice,
and to each gallon of juice thus obtained add from two to two
and a half pounds of white sugar (if the grapes are sweet, two
pounds will be enough), put the juice and sugar in a keg or
barrel, and cover the bung-hole with a piece of muslin, so the
gas can escape and dust and insects cannot get in; let it remain
perfectly quiet until cold weather, then bung up tightly. This
wine will need no clarifying; if allowed to rest perfectly still
it can be drawn off perfectly clear.&mdash;<i>Mr. W. A. S.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Grape Wine.</i></p>

<p>Pick the grapes from the bunch, mash thoroughly, and let

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Let it stand six weeks, or till fermentation ceases. Then close
the mouth of the cask and let the wine stand several months,
after which it may be drawn off.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Catawba Grape Wine.</i></p>

<p>To every gallon of grape juice add one quart of cold, clear
water, and three pounds of "A" sugar. Pour into a runlet and

<h2>THE SICK-ROOM&mdash;DIET AND REMEDIES FOR
THE SICK.</h2>

<p>First of all, let me say that after a reliable physician has been
called in, his directions should be strictly followed, and his instructions
should be the law in the sick-room. Have everything
in readiness for his admission immediately after his arrival,
as his time is valuable and it occasions him both annoyance and
loss of time to be kept waiting outside of the sick-room, after
reaching the house of the patient.</p>

<p>Pure air is of vital importance in the sick-room. Many
persons exclude fresh air for fear of dampness, but even damp
air is better than impure. Even in cold weather, there should
be a free circulation of air. If there are no ventilators, let the
air circulate from the tops of the windows, rather than admit
it by opening the door, which is apt to produce a draft. Meantime
keep up a good fire; if practicable, let it be a wood fire,
but if this be not attainable, have an open grate, with a coal
fire. The sight of a bright blaze is calculated to cheer the
patient, while the sight of a dark, close stove is depressing. By
no means allow a sick person to be in a room warmed by a flue
or register.</p>

<p>The old idea of darkening the sick-room is exploded. It
should be darkened only when the patient wishes to sleep. If
the eyes are weak, admit the sunshine from a quarter where it
will not fall upon them. The modern science of physics has
come to recognize sunshine as one of the most powerful of
remedial agencies, and cases are not rare in which invalids have
been restored to health by using sun-baths, and otherwise freely
enjoying the sunshine.</p>

<p>It is best to have no odors in the sick-room unless it be bay
rum, German cologne, or something else especially fancied by
the sick person. Where there is any unpleasant exhalation,
it is far better to let it escape by properly ventilating the room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
than to try to overcome it by the aid of perfumery. In fevers,
where there are offensive exhalations from the body, sponging
with tepid water will help to remove the odor, and will also
prove soothing to the patient. In winter, expose but a small
portion of the body at a time, in sponging. Then rub gently
with the hand or a coarse towel, and there will be no danger of
the patient's taking cold, even in winter.</p>

<p>Be careful to keep warm, soft flannels on the sick person in
winter. In summer, do not keep a pile of bedclothes on the
patient, even though chilly. It is better to keep up the circulation
by other means, such as rubbing or stimulants. Scrupulous
neatness should be observed about the bed-linen (as well
as the other appointments of the sick-room). Never use bed-quilts
or comforts; they are not only heavy, but retain the
exhalations from the body. Use soft, fleecy blankets instead.</p>

<p>The nurse should watch her opportunity of having the bedclothes
taken into the fresh air and shaken, and the bed made
up, when the patient has been lifted up and set in an easy-chair
near the fire. The arrangements about the bed should be
quickly made, so that the patient may be able to lie down
again as soon as fatigued. Let such sweeping and dusting as
are necessary be also done with dispatch, using a dust-pan to
receive the dust from the carpet. Avoid clouds of dust from
the carpet, and of ashes from the fireplace.</p>

<p>The nurse has a very important part to play, as physicians
say that nursing is of equal importance as medical attendance.
The nurse should be careful not to wear a dress that rustles,
nor shoes that creak, and if the patient has any fancy, or any
aversion connected with colors, she should regard it in her
dress. Indeed, the patient should be indulged in every fancy
that is not hurtful.</p>

<p>The nurse should be prompt in every arrangement. Where
blisters or poultices are to be used, she should not wait till the
last moment to prepare them, but should do so before uncovering
the patient to apply them, or even broaching the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
If anything painful or distasteful has to be undergone by the
patient, it should not be discussed beforehand with or before
the patient; but when all is in readiness, with cheerful and
soothing words, let it be done.</p>

<p>The patient should never be kept waiting for food, medicine,
bath, or any other requisite. Every arrangement should be
made beforehand to supply his or her needs in good time.
Crushed ice and other needful things should be kept always at
hand, so the patient may have them at any moment without
delay. Especially on the approach of night, try to provide
everything needed during the night, such as ice, mustard, hot
water, kindling wood, a large piece of soapstone for the feet,
as this is more cleanly and retains heat better than other
things used for the purpose. Other things, such as the nature
of the sickness may call for, should be thought of and provided
before nightfall.</p>

<p>As the sick are very fastidious, all food for them must be
prepared in the most delicate manner. Do not bring the
same article of food several times consecutively, but vary it
from time to time. Do not let a sick person have any article
of food forbidden by a physician, as there are many reasons
known to them only, why dishes fancied by the sick should be
injurious.</p>

<p>Avoid whispering, as this excites nervousness and apprehension
on the part of the sick. Do not ask in a mournful tone
of voice how the patient is. Indeed, it is best to ask the sick as
few questions as possible. It is far better to watch their symptoms
for yourself than to question them. Examine for yourself if
their feet are warm, and endeavor to discover their condition
and their wants, as far as possible, without questions.</p>

<p>In a case of illness, many well-meaning persons crowd to see
the patient; do not admit them into the sick-room, as it is both
exciting and fatiguing to an ill person to see company, and,
when in a critical condition, the balance might be disastrously
turned by the injudicious admission of visitors. Both mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
and body must be kept quiet to give the patient a chance for
recovery. When well enough to listen to conversation, the
patient should hear none but what is cheerful and entertaining,
never any of an argumentative or otherwise unpleasant
nature.</p>

<p>Do not allow the patient to read, as it is too great a tax on
the sight and brain before convalescence. Suitable books, in
large print, are a great resource to the patient when arrived at
this stage, but should be read only in moderation.</p>

<p>Driving out is a delightful recreation for convalescents, and
they should be indulged in it as soon as the physician pronounces
it safe. In winter, they should be carried driving about
noon, so as to enjoy the sunshine at its warmest. In summer,
the cool of the morning or evening is the best time to drive them
out; but if the latter time be chosen, be careful to return immediately
after sundown. Make arrangements for the patient
on returning to find the room thoroughly cleaned, aired, and
adorned with fresh flowers (always so cheering in a sick-room),
and let the bed be nicely made up and turned down. It is well
to have some little refreshment awaiting after the drive&mdash;a little
cream or milk toddy, a cup of tea or coffee, or, if the weather be
hot, some cooling draught perhaps would be more acceptable.
It is well to keep the convalescent cheered, by projecting each
day some new and pleasant little plan for the morrow.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Arrowroot.</span></p>

<p>Break an egg. Separate the yolk and white. Whip each to
a stiff froth. Add a tablespoonful of arrowroot and a little
water to the yolk. Rub till smooth and free from lumps. Pour
slowly into half a pint of boiling water, stirring all the time.
Let it simmer till jelly-like. Sweeten to the taste and add
a tablespoonful of French brandy. Stir in the frothed white
and take hot in winter. In summer, set first on ice, then stir
in the beaten white. Milk may be used instead of water.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span></p>

<p class="recipe"><i>Arrowroot.</i></p>

<p>Mix one tablespoonful arrowroot with enough cold water to

boil it about half an hour, adding salt and butter. Eat with
cream.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A. M.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Breakfast for an Invalid.</span></p>

<p>Bread twelve hours old, an egg and black tea.&mdash;<i>Mrs. A.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Food for a Sick Infant.</span></p>

<p>Gelatine two inches square, milk half a pint, water half a
pint, cream one-half to one gill, arrowroot a teaspoonful. Sweeten
to the taste.&mdash;<i>Mrs. J. D.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Wine Whey.</span></p>

<p>Put half pint milk over the fire, and, as soon as it begins to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
boil, pour slowly into it a wine-glass of sherry wine, mixed with
a teaspoonful white sugar. Grate into it a little nutmeg, and
as soon as it comes to a boil again, take it off the fire. When
cool, strain for use.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R. C. M. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Milk Punch.</span></p>

<p>Pour two tablespoonfuls good brandy into six tablespoonfuls
milk. Add two teaspoonfuls ground loaf sugar and a little
grated nutmeg. An adult may take a tablespoonful of this
every two or three hours, but children must take less.&mdash;<i>Mrs. R. C. M. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beef Essence.</span></p>

<p>Cut one pound beef in small bits, sprinkle with a very little
salt, tie up in a close stone jar, and set in boiling water. Boil
it hard an hour or more, then strain it. Chicken may be prepared
the same way. Nice for the sick.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Col. W.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Beef-Tea.</span></p>

<p>Take half a pound fresh beef for every pint of beef-tea
required. Carefully remove all fat, sinew, veins, and bone from
the beef. Cut it in pieces under an inch square and let it soak
twelve hours in one-third of the water required to be made into
tea. Then take it out and let it simmer three hours in the remaining
two-thirds of the water, the quantity lost by evaporation
being replaced from time to time. The boiling liquor is
then to be poured on the cold liquor in which the meat was
soaked. The solid meat is to be dried, pounded in a mortar,
and minced so as to cut up all strings in it, and mixed with the
liquid. When the beef-tea is made daily, it is convenient to
use one day's boiled meat for the next day's tea, as thus it has
time to dry and is more easily pounded. Avoid having it
sticky and too much jellied, when cold.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Essence of Chicken.</span></p>

<p>In a case of extreme sickness, when it is important that what
little nourishment the patient can take should be highly condensed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
the following is an excellent mode for concentrating, in
a small compass, all the nutritive properties of a chicken.</p>

<p>After picking the chicken, sprinkle a little salt over it and
cut it in pieces, as if for frying. Put the pieces in a small
glass jar (or wide-mouthed bottle), stop it tightly, and put it in
a pot of cold water, gradually heating the latter till it boils.
Let the jar of chicken remain in the water till the juices are
well extracted, then pour them off for the patient.&mdash;<i>Mrs. M. C. C.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Chicken Jelly.</span></p>

<p>Take a large chicken, cut the flesh from its bones, break the
bones, soak an hour in weak salt and water to extract the blood.
Put on in a stewpan with three pints of cold water. Simmer
till reduced to less than half its original quantity. Sprinkle
a little salt on it, and strain in a bowl. Keep on ice.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">A Nourishing Way to Prepare Chicken, Squirrel, or
Beef for the Sick.</span></p>

<p>Put in a clean, glazed jar or inner saucepan. Set this in
another vessel of boiling water. Cover closely, and keep boiling
for hours. Season the juice thus extracted with a little
salt, stir in a teaspoonful of fresh milk, and give to the patient.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Panada.</span></p>

<p>Lay six nice crackers in a bowl. Sprinkle over them powdered
sugar and a pinch of salt, adding a very small piece of fresh
butter. Pour boiling water over the crackers, and let them
remain near the fire half an hour. Then add a teaspoonful of
good French brandy, or a tablespoonful of Madeira wine, and a
little grated nutmeg.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Dry Toast.</span></p>

<p>Slice thin, some nice, white bread, perfectly sweet. Toast a

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Lime-Water.</span></p>

<p>This is easily prepared, and a bottle should always be kept
ready for use. It is an antidote to many poisons and a valuable
remedy in a sick-room. Put some pieces of unslacked lime
in a bottle, fill up with cold water, keep it corked and in a cool,
dark place. It does not matter about the quantity of lime, as
the water will not dissolve more than a certain quantity. It is
ready for use in a few minutes, and the clear lime-water can be
poured off as needed. When all the water is used, fill up again,
which may be done several times before it is necessary to use
fresh lime.&mdash;<i>Mrs. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Tarrant's Effervescent Seltzer Aperient.</span></p>

<p>Is an invaluable remedy for sick headache, nausea, constipation,
and many of the attendant evils of dyspepsia. Directions
accompany each bottle. Colic and other violent pains of the
stomach are sometimes instantly relieved by adding to the dose
of Seltzer Aperient a teaspoonful of Brown's Jamaica Ginger.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Brown's Jamaica Ginger.</span></p>

<p>Is not only an invaluable remedy, but a refreshing and delightful
drink may be made from it in summer, when iced lemonade
would be unsafe and iced juleps, etc., would be too heating for
one suffering from over-fatigue. Fill a goblet with crushed ice,
add two teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar and one of Jamaica ginger.
Fill up with water, stir and drink.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Mustard.</span></p>

<p>It is not safe to pass a day without mustard in the house, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
valuable are its medicinal properties. When a large plaster is
wanted, put into a plate or bowl two tablespoonfuls ground
mustard. Wet it with cold water and stir with a spoon or knife
till a smooth paste. Lay on an inverted tea-board a piece of
newspaper twice the size of the plaster wanted. On one-half
spread evenly and thinly the mustard. Fold over the other half
and fold over the edges as if to hem a piece of cloth, to prevent
the mustard from getting on the skin or clothing. In winter,
warm slightly before applying. Keep it on an adult fifteen
minutes; on a child, half that time. In this way, painful blisters
will always be avoided. If the pain is in the chest or stomach,
place the same plaster on the back just opposite, and let
it remain on twenty minutes the second time. Colman's mustard
is considered the best by many persons.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Mustard Leaves or Plasters.</span></p>

<p>It is well in travelling to carry a package of these plasters, in
case of sudden sickness. It is important also to keep them at
home, as sometimes they are needed suddenly in the night, and
even one moment gained is important in great emergencies.

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>HOUSE-CLEANING.</h2>

<p>Do not clean but one room at a time, as it is a bad plan to
have the whole house in confusion at once. It is best to commence
with the attic.</p>

<p>Before beginning on your spring cleaning, remove the curtains,
all the movable furniture, and the carpets. With a
broom and dust-pan remove all dust from the floor. Then
with a wall-brush thoroughly sweep and dust the ceiling and
side-walls, window and door frames, pictures and chandeliers.
Then go over the floor again, removing the dust that has fallen
from the ceiling and walls. Then proceed to wash all the paint
in the room. If it be white paint, use whiting or such other
preparations as are recommended for the purpose in the subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
pages. If it be varnished, or in imitation of oak or walnut,
wipe with a cloth dipped in milk-warm water. If the
wood work in the room be of unvarnished walnut or oak, wipe
it off first, and then oil it, rubbing in the oil well.</p>

<p>Then with a soft flannel rag and a cake of sapolio clean every
piece of marble in the room. Next wipe the mirrors carefully
with a flannel rag, wrung out of warm water and dipped in a
little whiting, or you may rub a little silver soap on the rag.
The gilding must be merely dusted, as the least dampness or a
drop of water will injure it.</p>

<p>The windows (sash and all) must then be washed in soap
and water, with a common brush such as is used for washing
paint. A little soda dissolved in the water will improve the
appearance of the windows. It is unnecessary to use such a
quantity of soap and water as to splash everything around.
After being washed, the windows should be polished with newspapers.
Except in a general house-cleaning, windows may be
cleaned by the directions given above for mirrors.</p>

<p>The metal about the door-knobs, tongs, etc., may be cleaned
by electro-silicon, and the grates may be varnished with the
black varnish kept for the purpose by dealers in grates, stoves,
etc. Every chair and article of furniture should be carefully
cleaned before being brought back into the room, and linen
covers should be put on the chairs. If you are going to put
down matting, do so before bringing back the first article of
furniture. Some housekeepers, however, allow their matting
to remain during the winter under their carpets. Spots on
matting may be removed by being scoured with a cloth, dipped
first in hot water and then in salt. This, however, will cause
wet spots to appear on it in damp weather. After the spots
are removed, scrub the matting with dry corn-meal and a coarse
cloth. Sweep it over several times, till all the meal is removed.</p>

<p>For persons who do not use matting in summer, a recipe is
given later for beautifully coloring the floor with boiled linseed
oil and burnt sienna. Where different woods are used alternately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
in the floor, this oil answers better than revarnishing the
floor every spring.</p>

<p>As soon as the carpets are taken up, have them nicely
shaken, swept, and brushed on both sides. Every spot should
be carefully washed and wiped dry. The carpets should then
be rolled up smoothly, with tobacco sprinkled between the
folds, sewed up in coarse linen cloths, and put away till autumn.
A cedar closet is an excellent place to keep carpets as well as
other woollens. If you have no cedar closet, however, a cedar
chest will serve to protect your woollen clothes against moths,
and it is better to preserve them in this way than to sprinkle
them with tobacco, which imparts an unpleasant scent to them.</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Whitewash for Outdoor Use.</span></p>

<p>Take good quick-lime in lumps. Slack it with hot water, and
while slacking add to what will make a pailful one pound
tallow or other grease, free from dirt. It may be rancid, smoked,
or otherwise unfit for kitchen use.</p>

<p>When the violent slacking is over, stir thoroughly. All the
water should be added before the slacking ceases, and the mixing
together should be thorough. Do not dilute with cold
water. If well made, it will be very smooth and but little
affected by rain.&mdash;<i>Mrs. E.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Indoor Whitewashing.</span></p>

<p>We have recently seen recommended in a journal a fine
and brilliant whitewash preparation of chalk, called "Paris
White," and said to be admirable for whitewashing walls. It sells
in paint stores at three cents per pound, retail. For every sixteen
pounds Paris White, get half a pound white transparent glue.
Cover the glue with cold water at night, and in the morning
heat it, without scorching, till dissolved. Stir in the Paris
White with hot water to give it a milky consistency. Then add
and mix well the glue. Apply with a common lime whitewash
brush. A single coating will do, except on very dingy walls.
Almost as brilliant as "Zinc White."&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Oil Floors.</span></p>

<p>To one gallon boiled linseed oil add half a pound burnt
sienna. The druggist who sells these articles will mix them.
If economy is necessary, instead of employing a painter to put
it on, dip a large woollen rag into the mixture, and with this
wipe over the floor.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">To Dye Floors a Pretty Color.</span></p>

this dries off, rub with a waxed brush.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Dr. P. C.</i></p>

hot water. Stir till dissolved and pour into the boiling soap.

<p>Heat a large flat-iron, place it in a pan, and lay on it a wet
cloth. The steam will rise rapidly. Hold the right side of the
velvet over it. If this does not restore the pile, wet it
on the wrong side. Have a smooth flat-iron very hot. Set
it on the edge of the table, upright. If it is a narrow piece
of velvet, it may be easily ironed by passing the wet side against
the iron. If a large piece, have some one to hold the bottom
of the iron upwards while the wet side of the velvet is passed
over it.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES.</h2>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Ammonia.</span></p>

<p>No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of ammonia,
for, besides its medical value, it is highly useful for
household purposes. It is nearly as useful as soap, and its
cheapness brings it in the reach of all. Put a teaspoonful
ammonia in a quart of warm soapsuds, dip in a flannel cloth,
wipe off the dust and fly-specks, and see how much scrubbing it
will save you.</p>

<p>For washing windows and mirrors, it is very desirable. A
few drops on a piece of paper will take off every spot or fingermark
on the glass.</p>

<p>It cleanses and brightens silver wonderfully. Dip your
forks, spoons, etc., in a pint of suds, mixed with a teaspoonful
spirits ammonia. Then rub with a brush and polish with
chamois skin.</p>

<p>It will take grease spots from every fabric. Put on the
ammonia nearly clear. Lay blotting-paper on the place, and
press a hot flat-iron on it a few moments. A few drops of it
will clean and whiten laces, also muslins.</p>

<p>It is highly useful and refreshing at the toilet-table. A few
drops in the bath will remove all offensive perspiration and
glossiness (if the skin is oily). Nothing is better for cleansing
the hair from dust and dandruff. A teaspoonful in a pint of
water will cleanse the dirtiest brushes. Shake the brushes
through the water, and when they look white, rinse them in
water and put them in the sunshine or a warm place to dry.</p>

<p>For medicinal purposes ammonia is almost unrivalled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
Inhaling it will often cure headache and catarrhal cold. Ten
drops aromatic spirits of ammonia in a wine-glass of water is
excellent for heartburn or dyspepsia. The ordinary spirits of
ammonia may be used also for the purpose, but it is not so
palatable.</p>

<p>Ammonia is also good for vegetation. If you desire roses,
fuschias, geraniums, etc., to become more flourishing, add five
or six drops ammonia to every pint of lukewarm water you give
them. Do not repeat this more than once in five or six days,
lest you should stimulate them too highly.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep a large bottle of ammonia in the house, and
use a glass stopper for it, as it is very evanescent and is injurious
to corks.</p>

<p>[The above remarks on the usefulness of ammonia were furnished
and endorsed by Mrs. A. D., of Virginia.]</p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Borax.</span></p>

<p>It is very desirable to keep borax in the house. Its effect is
to soften the hardest water, and it is excellent for cleansing
the hair. Some washerwomen use borax for a washing powder,
instead of soda, in the proportion of a handful of borax powder
to ten gallons boiling water, and they save in soap nearly half,
whilst the borax, being a neutral salt, does not injure the texture
of the linen.&mdash;<i>Mrs. S. T.</i></p>

<p class="recipe"><span class="smcap">Red Ink.</span></p>
